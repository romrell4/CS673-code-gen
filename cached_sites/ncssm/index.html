founders — former North Carolina Governor James B. Hunt Jr.; former North Carolina governor, senator and Duke University president Terry Sanford; and academician and author John Ehle — envisioned an institution that would invest in the state&#39;s human and intellectual capital to build leadership and economic progress.\n\n\nIn 1980, during Governor Hunt&#39;s first administration, North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics opened on the grounds of the former Watts Hospital in Durham with 150 high school juniors. It was the first school of its kind — a public, residential high school welcoming students from across the state to study a specialized curriculum emphasizing science and mathematics but also offering humanities courses, athletics, and extracurricular opportunities.\n\n\nThe founders&#39; early vision has matured into a vital institution that models and advocates for excellence in public education. In 2007, the school became the 17th constituent of the University of North Carolina system. \nNCSSM Alumni \nOpening opportunities for students from every corner of our state\n\n\nEach year we enroll talented students from all 13 congressional districts and nearly each of North Carolina&#39;s 100 counties. \nEvolving into an online resource and partner to teachers, school districts\n\n\nWe began as a residential school, but we&#39;ve grown to be so much more. During the 2014-2015 academic year, for the first time, more students were enrolled in NCSSM Online (720) than in our residential program (680). We also offer courses, professional development, and other resources for teachers and school districts across the state. \nNationally recognized, internationally admired\n\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Newsweek has ranked NCSSM as a top public high school in the country. The Washington Post also categorizes NCSSM as one of the top-performing high schools nationwide. A number of schools globally have modeled themselves after our school. \nProving North Carolina students can compete and win globally\n\n\nWithin the last 5 years, NCSSM students have won or placed in the Singapore International Mathematics Challenge, Conrad Spirit of Innovation Award, Moody’s Mathematics Challenge, and scores of other contests — a good sign for our state&#39;s economy and future. \nCultivating community, offering\n\nreal-world learning experiences\n\n\nWe require all students to complete 60 hours of service with a North Carolina nonprofit before their senior year. We also encourage internships, mentorships, and other opportunities to be engaged in real-world learning experiences. \nA young school evolves:\n\ntimeline of key dates\n\n\n1978 \n\nThe North Carolina General Assembly establishes the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics to provide challenging educational opportunities for students with special interests and potential in the sciences and mathematics.\n\n\n1980 \n\nFirst class of 150 juniors enters the school, on the grounds of the former Watts Hospital in Durham\n\n\n1988 \n\nTogether with peers at a handful of similar schools, NC School of Science and Math leaders helps found the National Consortium of Specialized Secondary Schools of Math, Science and Technology, now the National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools\n\n\n1994 \n\nNCSSM offers its first distance education classes, broadcasting on public television channels\n\n\n2007 \n\nNCSSM becomes the 17th constituent institution of the University of North Carolina system\n\n\n2008 \n\nFirst cohort, the Class of 2010, enters NCSSM Online, earning certificates of completion by supplementing their education at local high schools with virtual courses\n\n\n2011\n\nNCSSM sets the Guinness world record for largest food drive in single location in 24 hours, collecting 559,885 pounds of food to benefit the Food Bank of Central &amp; Eastern North Carolina, which serves 34 counties in our state.\n\n\n  \n8,200 alumni\n\n\nOur alumni are making an impact in wide-ranging fields — as leaders in the sciences, technology, education, business, the arts and more, across North Carolina and beyond. Meet a few of them here.\n\n\nLearn about some of them here \nInnovation: It&#39;s in our school&#39;s DNA.\n\n\nOur school&#39;s three founders — former North Carolina Governor James B.

Planning Process&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2016, North Carolina voters passed the Connect NC bond package which included $58 million to grow a second campus of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Morganton (NCSSM). Planning commenced in late-2016 with the hiring of an architectural firm, educational program design consultants, and a planning director. NCSSM will open its second campus in 2021 with an initial enrollment of 300 students.  A comprehensive dashboard is available below to review milestones and learn more about the planning timeline and process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duda|Paine Architects has been engaged as the architectural team and the William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at NC State University has been retained by NCSSM as the educational program design consultant.  Their work is being supported by the planning director and a core planning team of 23 alumni, educators, and partners in business and government.  The educational program vision and site recommendation will be presented to the NCSSM Board of Trustees in September 2017 for review and approval.

This included an overview of engagement activities connected to advanced planning from Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning at NCSSM; initial recommendations for the educational programmatic vision from Trip Stallings, Director of Policy Research at the Friday Institute; and a report of the site evaluation process from Darren Lathan, Senior Associate at Duda|Paine Architects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the western campus update, a formal recommendation of the site location in Morganton was presented to the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees approved the recommendation that the NCSSM-Morganton campus be located on the &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/cfiTKYxVGsI\"&gt;eastern ridge of the North Carolina School for the Deaf&lt;/a&gt;, a property currently managed by the state’s Department of Public Instruction. This decision follows months of research and on-site analysis by Duda|Paine Architects and resulting consensus that was achieved among members of the NCSSM Western Campus Core Planning Team. Chancellor Todd Roberts also endorsed the recommendation that advanced to the Board of Trustees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Today’s action by the NCSSM Board of Trustees represents a milestone for our institution,” says Tom Williams, Chair of the NCSSM Board of Trustees. “We are excited to continue our western campus planning efforts with an eye toward presenting the overall educational program vision in Morganton later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The proposed site was selected among three options that are each located within the 800-acres adjacent to I-40 and bordered by Burkemont Avenue, Fleming Drive, Sterling Street, and Enola Road. The eastern ridge of the North Carolina School for the Deaf emerged as the preferred location following an analysis of a multitude of factors to include safety and security, green space, and connectivity to downtown and educational partners. The recommendation was celebrated by members of the NCSSM community and partners across the state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today’s announcement is a positive next step for greater educational access for our citizens in the Unifour region of our state,” says Margaret Spellings, President of the University of North Carolina. “The creation of an NCSSM campus in western North Carolina will strengthen our efforts to deliver a world-class STEM education to many more of our state’s most talented students, and I applaud Chancellor Roberts and the members of the NCSSM Board of Trustees for their leadership and vision.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mark Johnson, North Carolina’s Superintendent of Public Instruction, agrees. “The expansion of NCSSM is exciting for students and families all across North Carolina,” says Johnson. “The western campus will provide more opportunities for students on one of the most beautiful settings in the entire state. I look forward to all the collaboration ahead for North Carolina students and educators at the western campus.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;State Representative Hugh Blackwell shares similar excitement about the project. “Having worked hard to bring a new North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics to Burke County and western North Carolina,” he says, “I am elated with the announcement that an actual building site for the new school has been identified. This puts us in excellent position to stay on schedule to admit the first students in fall 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Board of Trustees also received a draft report of the educational programmatic vision for the new campus during the meeting. The report includes a series of recommendations informed by thousands of recommendations that were shared through surveys, focus groups, design charrettes, and community events.

A &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus/dashboard\"&gt;comprehensive dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is available to review milestones and learn more about the planning timeline and process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duda|Paine Architects has been engaged as the architectural team and the William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at NC State University has been retained by NCSSM as the educational program design consultant.  Their work was supported by the director of western campus planning and a core planning team of 23 alumni, educators, and partners in business and government.  An overview of the advance planning process has been captured on &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3seEVxzAH7E\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=Ap9XufqtH0o\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;by NCSSM alumnus Caleb Owolabi &#39;11.  The educational program vision and site recommendation were presented to the NCSSM Board of Trustees in September 2017 and each was unanimously approved at that meeting.  The materials, as presented, are available below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgb1Jtbko5d1ItNkE\"&gt;Overall Project Summary: The Road to Morganton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgeTdQcVUxN0NIc2tQRnAyQUNKOVMwb2xKWUZF\"&gt;Educational Program Vision Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgXzRraUcwdHZjZ0RZYkN1ZmVHS1ZxUUpPTzZn\"&gt;Educational Program Vision Report - Executive Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgRThwN19zc21WNWc\"&gt;Master Plan Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgS2VsU0hFLVRrLUU\"&gt;Master Plan Report - Executive Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW! &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_t_iJl8OnImaLFEjRXfg8j3iWgg-XHio/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;Final Report: NCSSM-Morganton Academic Steering Team &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW! &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQhRwNsrVxi9l7IZ8oLfE5_VDFJuxznj/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;Final Report: NCSSM-Morganton Student Experience Steering Team &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are grateful for the support of North Carolina voters in passing the Connect NC bond package.

Having operated in the region since 1988, Case Farms is highly invested in the community and employs more than 1,000 people in the Morganton area. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case Farms’ $100,000 gift will help fund the development of the new campus that will open in 2021 and provide a cutting-edge education for high schoolers from across the state. NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top faculty and mentors in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields with an added focus on data science.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“This new campus will help mentor the next generation of leaders and we are honored to support the school’s vision,” said Charles Rigdon, senior vice president of operations at Case Farms. “Case Farms knows the importance of education and we hope our donation will help provide opportunities for students in this community and across North Carolina for years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM’s expansion to Morganton is generating new opportunities for people and businesses to partner with the institution to enable the innovative programming and infrastructure that is a hallmark of the NCSSM experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We are so grateful for Case Farms’ investment in our new Morganton campus which is yet another example of the incredible support we are receiving from the local community,” said Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning for NCSSM. “We are thrilled to build our new campus in Morganton, not only bringing the promise of NCSSM to hundreds more students, but also serving as a catalyst for economic development in the region beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM is actively engaged in a capital campaign that includes a goal of raising $10 million in private donations to support the construction of the Morganton campus. To date, the NCSSM Foundation has recorded more than 250 gifts that total more than $7,000,000 in support of NCSSM’s emerging campus in Morganton. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the capital campaign, visit ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=\"text-align:center;\"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About NCSSM: &lt;/strong&gt;The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics is a world-class public high school with statewide reach offering students the skills and knowledge to design their own future.

At today’s groundbreaking event, Carolinas HealthCare System Blue Ridge presented a gift of $5 million, which conveys naming rights for a comprehensive student wellness and activities center to be built on the NCSSM-Morganton campus.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;CHS Blue Ridge’s $5 million gift represents a significant step toward the $10 million goal to complete construction of the new Morganton campus. This support is also representative of the growing number of donors who help sustain excellence, innovation, and achievement across our three campuses in Durham, Morganton, and Online. The groundbreaking ceremony for NCSSM-Morganton provided the perfect backdrop against which to celebrate this leadership gift among the many others that have made a major impact on our immediate needs and our plans for the future. Fundraising for the Morganton campus is one part of a larger comprehensive campaign that will expand the resources available for NCSSM’s statewide mission — including tens of millions of dollars in private and public investments for upgrades and improvements on the Durham campus.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;Our founders envisioned the NCSSM experience as one of many opportunities. Our expansion into Online and now to Morganton underscores that there are truly no boundaries placed on our educational mission and impact. Our institution is not fixed in time and place, but increasingly transcends generations and locations. Expansion to Western NC will give even more students the opportunity to discover their interests and talents, to prepare to lead, serve, and tackle the challenges faced by our state, our nation, and our world.

More students, faculty, staff, and friends will experience the transformative effect of NCSSM and will in turn, as you do every day, share their unique gifts with our school, this state, and beyond.\n\n\n \n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nTodd\n\n\n \n\n\nTodd Roberts, Ed.D.\n\n\nChancellor","_author":{"_id":"4016419787839704","type":"person","groupIds":["831287658225102007"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Roberts","title":"Todd Roberts","email":"roberts@ncssm.edu","phone":"919-416-2700","departmentIds":["221423314561606179","725376149204881873"],"jobTitle":"Chancellor","startDate":"August 2010","slug":"todd-roberts","residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"limit":1,"aspectRatio":[1,1],"itemType":{"widget":true,"label":"Image(s)","icon":"icon-image","css":"slideshow"},"widget":true,"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w359781923711071933","ids":["196692033561044377"],"extras":{"196692033561044377":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":10,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"196692033561044377","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-11-17T15:56:32.593Z","name":"robert-todd563","title":"roberts todd","extension":"jpg","md5":"fca581b66f2d7f4bccb53b88dd6ef61c","width":172,"height":228,"searchText":"robert todd563 roberts todd none todd roberts none jpg images jpeg lisa watts","portrait":true,"ownerId":"26034325849012107","crops":[{"top":"28","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"},{"top":"10","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"},{"top":"13","left":"0","width":"172","height":"201"}],"description":"","credit":"","tags":["todd roberts"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":10,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"todd-roberts:thumbnail"},"body":"I am a native of Durham (born in Watts Hospital, actually!) and I began my education career as a Durham Public Schools teacher and principal.

North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) announced today a $5 million gift from &lt;a href=\"https://www.carolinashealthcareblueridge.org/\"&gt;Carolinas HealthCare System Blue Ridge&lt;/a&gt; at the groundbreaking ceremony for the school’s new campus in Morganton. The gift conveys naming rights for a state-of-the-art comprehensive student wellness and activities center at NCSSM-Morganton. This is the largest gift in the 40-year history of NCSSM, an internationally recognized leader in high school STEM education and a member of the 17-campus &lt;a href=\"https://www.northcarolina.edu/\"&gt;University of North Carolina System&lt;/a&gt;. CHS Blue Ridge, a community healthcare system with hospitals in Morganton and Valdese, has been serving families in the community for nearly 113 years and sees this gift as a way to support the future prosperity and well-being of the region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The new school represents a significant investment in our community,” said Kathy C. Bailey, President and CEO of CHS Blue Ridge. “We feel the school will bring new families and jobs to the area which will enhance the quality of life for those in our community including our own employees.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The board felt very strongly about this donation and we worked hard to make it happen,” said Mike Bridges, Chairman of the CHS Blue Ridge Board of Directors. “We are committed to improving health, of course, and economics plays a large part of that. We want to make this a successful venture for Burke County.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM Chancellor Todd Roberts was honored to accept the gift on behalf of NCSSM-Morganton on Friday. “We are extremely grateful to CHS Blue Ridge for its investment in our new campus and steadfast commitment to the Unifour region,” Roberts said. “This extraordinary gift represents the largest private donation in our school’s history and will help bring the NCSSM experience to hundreds more students each year.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top instructors and mentors in science, technology, engineering, and math. Recognizing the contributions NCSSM has made in its four decades of educating business leaders, entrepreneurs, and even an astronaut, stakeholders from across the state see NCSSM-Morganton as a catalyst for economic development. The school is forging innovative partnerships in the western part of the state that are helping to develop the campus and curriculum through monetary donations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“With the advent of NCSSM-Morganton, our university system reaches into new territory by adding a campus in the Unifour region,” said Dr. Bill Roper, Interim President of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.northcarolina.edu/\"&gt;University of North Carolina System&lt;/a&gt;. “NCSSM is known nationally and internationally as a world-class teaching institution and this new campus will further our mission to bring transformative results for our entire state and its citizens — empowering students, spurring innovation, and enriching the surrounding communities.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CHS Blue Ridge’s $5 million gift represents a significant step toward the $10 million goal to support construction of the new Morganton campus. The gift also puts the total raised for the new campus at more than $7 million since 2018. The groundbreaking ceremony for NCSSM-Morganton provided the perfect backdrop against which to celebrate this leadership gift among the many others that have made a major impact on the fundraising goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Since day one, NCSSM-Morganton has benefited from an incredibly passionate cross-section of champions and investors who span all sectors and represent local, state, and national connections,” said Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning. “Today’s groundbreaking ceremony illustrated this support as more than 500 partners and friends braved the heat to celebrate and commemorate the start of construction for the campus that will open in fall 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM offers an innovative and immersive growth experience for North Carolina’s brightest minds. The new campus will provide living and learning space for 300 academically-talented students from across North Carolina and increase distance education and summer learning opportunities for many more, extending NCSSM’s world-renowned academic programs beyond its original home in Durham. NCSSM is the only high school among the 17 campuses of the UNC System and will be the first program of its kind anywhere with two physical locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the capital campaign, visit &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus\"&gt;ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;###&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n**&lt;a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/z6ntRByJTUdwnbNF7\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Images will be available in this folder&lt;/a&gt; following the groundbreaking event.**&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mo9jj0Mx4d1VoxpZmopsEOFi4evE3KnO/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Access the groundbreaking event program here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About NCSSM:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/\"&gt;The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; is a world-class public high school with statewide reach offering students the skills and knowledge to design their own future.

It will strengthen the network for WPCC by providing increased opportunities for those pursuing a post secondary education and participating in workforce development programs, empowering rural North Carolinians with in-demand skills for regional industry.  \n\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal was supported by community partners including Burke County, Burke County Chamber of Commerce, Burke Development Inc., Western Piedmont Community College, and the City of Morganton as well as the statewide organizations of MCNC and the NC Rural Center.\n\n\n ","_author":{"_id":"77486040830680451","type":"person","createdAt":"2018-08-08T18:14:23.218Z","login":true,"directory":true,"published":true,"firstName":"Margo","lastName":"Metzger","title":"Margo Metzger &#39;97","email":"margo.metzger@ncssm.edu","phone":"","departmentIds":["336715775307835564"],"undefined":{"336715775307835564":{}},"jobTitle":"Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate","startDate":"August 7, 2018","tags":[],"residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w435444738112984037","ids":["487767666233863984"],"extras":{"487767666233863984":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"487767666233863984","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2018-08-14T19:59:21.703Z","name":"margo-metzger","title":"Margo Metzger","extension":"jpg","md5":"4c01b5f2c094c086f0720035231221c7","width":1024,"height":1536,"searchText":"margo metzger margo metzger none ncssm morganton none jpg images jpeg will mack 03","portrait":true,"ownerId":"412642278318013293","crops":[{"top":"256","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"},{"top":"4","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"}],"description":"","credit":"","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"margo-metzger:thumbnail"},"body":"Margo Knight Metzger &#39;97 is the Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate for the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and works on the Morganton Campus project.

The grant will convey naming rights to be determined at the school’s new campus that will open in Morganton in 2021. BWF is the largest single contributor in the history of NCSSM with a cumulative total of nearly $3.2 million. This latest grant will help foster a cutting edge learning experience for students, as the school drives continuous educational innovation with a data-science influenced program that includes applied learning experiences with regional institutions and industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“This partnership with BWF brings together two respected institutions focused on research, mentorship, and real world learning for aspiring young North Carolinians,“ said NCSSM Chancellor Todd Roberts. “This grant will extend the curriculum in ways that foster development of  future STEM leaders in North Carolina.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BWF’s mission is to advance the biomedical sciences by supporting research and other scientific and educational activities. In addition to providing support for early career scientists to become independent investigators and enhancing underfunded fields in biomedical science, BWF is a major contributor to the advancement of STEM education in North Carolina. Its mission aligns with NCSSM, as the new campus will feature a curriculum centered around data science designed to equip the next generation of problem solvers in medicine, technology, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe the best method for engaging students in science is to allow students to immerse themselves in the scientific process and let them do what comes naturally — ask questions,” said Dr. John Burris, President of BWF. “NCSSM-Morganton will give more North Carolina students the chance to participate in hands-on, cutting-edge experiments in partnership with local industries, better preparing them for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM is a bastion of innovation offering the promise of an immersive growth experience for North Carolina’s brightest minds. Construction on the residential high school in Morganton begins June 21 and will be completed in time for the 2021-2022 school year. The new campus will provide learning and living space for 300 academically-talented students from across North Carolina, extending its world-renowned academic programs beyond its original home in Durham.

Leviton, an engineering giant with an innovative range of products for electrical, lighting and network solutions, has operated in the region for more than 50 years, and they see this gift as a way to support NCSSM’s mission of growing future leaders and problem solvers in their industry and state. NCSSM’s expansion to Morganton is creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals to partner with the institution to enable the innovative programming and infrastructure that is a hallmark of the NCSSM experience.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leviton’s $250,000 gift to name a state-of-the-art engineering lab is the latest donation made during this fundraising period for the new NCSSM-Morganton campus, slated to open in 2021. NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top instructors and mentors in STEM fields with an added focus on data science. Recognizing the contributions NCSSM has made in its four decades of educating business leaders, entrepreneurs, &lt;a href=\"https://www.northcarolina.edu/node/3945\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;and even astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, stakeholders from across the state see NCSSM-Morganton as a catalyst for economic development in the western part of the state and are helping to develop the campus and curriculum through monetary donations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“For over 50 years, Leviton has been proud to be a part of Morganton and Burke County and has been dedicated to supporting the advancement of this community and Western North Carolina,” said Glenn Privette, Director of Human Resources for Leviton. Tim Lockard, Senior Director of Operations added, “It is exciting to see and to be a part of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics’ historic expansion to a new campus in our region. This school is vital to the development and future of our educational system and youth.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning, was honored to accept the check on behalf of NCSSM-Morganton on Monday, and he is excited to see fundraising gaining momentum as the campus development continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We are incredibly grateful to Leviton for their investment in our new campus and their ongoing commitment to the Unifour region,” Baxter said. “This generous gift represents the largest private donation received to date for NCSSM-Morganton and speaks to the value that Leviton assigns to the mission and impact of our institution.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM announced a &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/donate/ncssm-morganton-capital-projects\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Barn Raising Campaign&lt;/a&gt; for the Morganton campus in fall 2018 with a goal of raising $3 million in private donations from regional stakeholders to support the construction of its new campus. To date, the NCSSM Foundation has recorded more than 100 gifts that total more than $500,000 in support of NCSSM’s emerging campus in Morganton. Inaugural members of the NCSSM-Morganton donor recognition society will be celebrated during a special, invitation-only event connected to the campus groundbreaking on the evening of June 21.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the Barn Raising Campaign, visit &lt;a

the company’s $250,000 donation to create the Leviton Engineering Lab at the school’s new campus in Morganton. Leviton, an engineering giant with an innovative range of products for electrical, lighting and network solutions, has operated in the region for more than 50 years, and they see this gift as a way to support NCSSM’s mission of growing future leaders and problem solvers in their industry and state. NCSSM’s expansion to Morganton is creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals to partner with the institution to enable the innovative programming and infrastructure that is a hallmark of the NCSSM experience.\n\n\n \n\n\nLeviton’s $250,000 gift to name a state-of-the-art engineering lab is the latest donation made during this fundraising period for the new NCSSM-Morganton campus, slated to open in 2021. NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top instructors and mentors in STEM fields with an added focus on data science. Recognizing the contributions NCSSM has made in its four decades of educating business leaders, entrepreneurs, and even astronauts, stakeholders from across the state see NCSSM-Morganton as a catalyst for economic development in the western part of the state and are helping to develop the campus and curriculum through monetary donations.\n\n\n“For over 50 years, Leviton has been proud to be a part of Morganton and Burke County and has been dedicated to supporting the advancement of this community and Western North Carolina,” said Glenn Privette, Director of Human Resources for Leviton. Tim Lockard, Senior Director of Operations added, “It is exciting to see and to be a part of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics’ historic expansion to a new campus in our region. This school is vital to the development and future of our educational system and youth.”\n\n\nKevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning, was honored to accept the check on behalf of NCSSM-Morganton on Monday, and he is excited to see fundraising gaining momentum as the campus development continues.\n\n\n“We are incredibly grateful to Leviton for their investment in our new campus and their ongoing commitment to the Unifour region,” Baxter said. “This generous gift represents the largest private donation received to date for NCSSM-Morganton and speaks to the value that Leviton assigns to the mission and impact of our institution.”\n\n\nNCSSM announced a Barn Raising Campaign for the Morganton campus in fall 2018 with a goal of raising $3 million in private donations from regional stakeholders to support the construction of its new campus. To date, the NCSSM Foundation has recorded more than 100 gifts that total more than $500,000 in support of NCSSM’s emerging campus in Morganton. Inaugural members of the NCSSM-Morganton donor recognition society will be celebrated during a special, invitation-only event connected to the campus groundbreaking on the evening of June 21.  \n\n\nFor more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the Barn Raising Campaign, visit ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus.\n","_author":{"_id":"77486040830680451","type":"person","createdAt":"2018-08-08T18:14:23.218Z","login":true,"directory":true,"published":true,"firstName":"Margo","lastName":"Metzger","title":"Margo Metzger &#39;97","email":"margo.metzger@ncssm.edu","phone":"","departmentIds":["336715775307835564"],"undefined":{"336715775307835564":{}},"jobTitle":"Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate","startDate":"August 7, 2018","tags":[],"residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w435444738112984037","ids":["487767666233863984"],"extras":{"487767666233863984":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"487767666233863984","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2018-08-14T19:59:21.703Z","name":"margo-metzger","title":"Margo Metzger","extension":"jpg","md5":"4c01b5f2c094c086f0720035231221c7","width":1024,"height":1536,"searchText":"margo metzger margo metzger none ncssm morganton none jpg images jpeg will mack 03","portrait":true,"ownerId":"412642278318013293","crops":[{"top":"256","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"},{"top":"4","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"}],"description":"","credit":"","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"margo-metzger:thumbnail"},"body":"Margo Knight Metzger &#39;97 is the Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate for the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and works on the Morganton Campus project.

Kevin Baxter, director of western campus planning for North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, announced the formation of two new steering teams that will focus on external engagement and campus operations Morganton. In both cases, the teams comprise diverse people representing the institution, the UNC System, K-12 and higher education, business and industry, and governments throughout western North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oahTpXSN-v4CDHqDRv9LI9DuR2-RKtarE6BKYeLYl0Q/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;External Engagement Steering Team&lt;/a&gt; will advise and inform NCSSM-Morganton planning through the development of strategic initiatives aimed at building a robust and inclusive community of champions and benefactors. This work will particularly address the need for an additional $20 million to support the construction of the campus to meet the vision laid out in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus/site-location\"&gt;master plan&lt;/a&gt;. NCSSM is committed to raising $5 million in private support while advocating for $15 million in state appropriations for the capital construction needs of the new campus, scheduled to open in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robin Nicholson, government and community relations district manager for Duke Energy, is one of 15 members named to the external engagement steering team. “Education, and especially STEM education, of our future leaders is a process we must begin now,” she says. “Expanding NCSSM to Burke County is a significant step for education, the economy, our citizens of North Carolina, and the overall health of this area. Duke Energy is honored to be a strong participant in the planning and development of this expansion and looks forward to working with all students and leadership of this campus.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uq12XPF4TNmEZDIF0WMXJD1hWJiFZkefTXrgTaDvFvs/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;Campus Operations Steering Team&lt;/a&gt; will engage an equally important focus, advising and informing NCSSM-Morganton planning on schematic design, physical infrastructure, business processes, innovative partnerships throughout the region and state, and the connections of the new campus within the broader institution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Campus Operations Steering Team comprises 16 leaders from across the region and the institution. David Bennett, chief operating officer at EJ Victor and cofounder of Fonta Flora Brewery in Morganton, is one of those who answered the call to serve: “As a native of Morganton, I am honored and humbled to be part of a project that has the potential to shape our region for years to come.

Kevin Baxter, director of western campus planning for North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, announced the formation of two new steering teams that will focus on external engagement and campus operations Morganton. In both cases, the teams comprise diverse people representing the institution, the UNC System, K-12 and higher education, business and industry, and governments throughout western North Carolina.\n\n\nThe External Engagement Steering Team will advise and inform NCSSM-Morganton planning through the development of strategic initiatives aimed at building a robust and inclusive community of champions and benefactors. This work will particularly address the need for an additional $20 million to support the construction of the campus to meet the vision laid out in the master plan. NCSSM is committed to raising $5 million in private support while advocating for $15 million in state appropriations for the capital construction needs of the new campus, scheduled to open in 2021.\n\n\nRobin Nicholson, government and community relations district manager for Duke Energy, is one of 15 members named to the external engagement steering team. “Education, and especially STEM education, of our future leaders is a process we must begin now,” she says. “Expanding NCSSM to Burke County is a significant step for education, the economy, our citizens of North Carolina, and the overall health of this area. Duke Energy is honored to be a strong participant in the planning and development of this expansion and looks forward to working with all students and leadership of this campus.”\n\n\nThe Campus Operations Steering Team will engage an equally important focus, advising and informing NCSSM-Morganton planning on schematic design, physical infrastructure, business processes, innovative partnerships throughout the region and state, and the connections of the new campus within the broader institution.\n\n\nThe Campus Operations Steering Team comprises 16 leaders from across the region and the institution. David Bennett, chief operating officer at EJ Victor and cofounder of Fonta Flora Brewery in Morganton, is one of those who answered the call to serve: “As a native of Morganton, I am honored and humbled to be part of a project that has the potential to shape our region for years to come. Having the western campus of NCSSM located in Morganton is a generational event, and how the campus is woven into the existing fabric of our community will be extremely important in providing educational and enrichment opportunities for its students.”\n\n\nNCSSM is excited to engage these partners as phase two of planning is initiated. While the work of these two steering teams has begun, the institution envisions the rollout of three additional teams this summer, provided operational support is approved by the General Assembly. “We are indebted to so many who have invested their time and talent in the NCSSM-Morganton planning process,” said Todd Roberts, NCSSM’s chancellor. “This next phase of activity will be especially important in identifying critically needed funding for the project while also designing an innovative and efficient infrastructure to manage our new campus.”  \n\n\nThis next planning period will seek to capitalize on the positive outcomes and framework of the project’s initial phase, according to Baxter. “As you may recall, our core planning team worked alongside administrators, architects, and consultants to wrap up our advance planning phase for the project last fall. We are now prepared to operationalize much of this work as we construct the eighteenth campus of the UNC System, the first such campus commissioned to deliver a comprehensive, modern approach toward STEM education in western North Carolina.”","_category":{"_id":"684891561223034135","type":"category","createdAt":"2015-10-07T17:52:05.012Z","title":"On Campus","published":true,"categoryType":"news","slug":"on-campus","sortTitle":"on campus","publishedAt":"2015-10-07T17:52:05.013Z","highSearchText":"on campus undefined on campus on campus news","highSearchWords":["on","campus","undefined","news"],"lowSearchText":"on campus undefined on campus on campus news","searchSummary":""},"_author":{"_id":"733511375983589659","type":"person","createdAt":"2016-12-08T00:02:36.124Z","login":true,"directory":true,"published":true,"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Baxter","title":"Kevin Baxter","email":"kevin.baxter@ncssm.edu","phone":"828-448-3540","departmentIds":["336715775307835564"],"undefined":{"336715775307835564":{}},"jobTitle":"Director of Western Campus Planning and Project Management","startDate":"January 9, 2017","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"limit":1,"aspectRatio":[1,1],"itemType":{"widget":true,"label":"Image(s)","icon":"icon-image","css":"slideshow"},"widget":true,"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w881044940201260871","ids":["912487148664267013"],"extras":{"912487148664267013":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"912487148664267013","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2019-10-01T20:41:28.229Z","name":"kevin-baxter","title":"Kevin Baxter","extension":"jpg","md5":"e534eedc4550dc9223923f328b7753fd","width":644,"height":644,"searchText":"kevin baxter kevin baxter none ncssm morganton none jpg images jpeg will mack 03","portrait":true,"ownerId":"412642278318013293","description":"","credit":"","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]}],"type":"area","slug":"kevin-baxter:thumbnail"},"body":"Kevin Baxter is the Director of Western Campus Planning for the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.

\nFlexible ways to reach advanced students \nFlexible ways to reach your advanced students\n\n\n\n\nUsing our interactive video conferencing studios and our expertise in STEM education for talented students, we help public schools offer courses in hard-to-staff subject areas. It&#39;s a low- to no-cost way to support your STEM goals and offer advanced coursework to smaller groups of students.\n\n\nAffiliate partnerships\n\n\nIn our affiliate partnerships, we provide interactive video conferencing enrichment sessions to a district’s students and/or district-specific teacher professional development sessions. Students and teachers from Greene County Schools, for example, regularly attend events and workshops such as our Ethics and Leadership Conference at NCSSM’s Durham campus. Greene County teachers also make use of videos and other digital assets and interactive video conference offerings to enrich their current class materials.\n\n\nCooperative partnerships\n\n\nThrough cooperative partnerships, we provide courses for credit to students through interactive video conferencing. The Mt. Airy City Schools superintendent and high school staff, for example, turned one classroom into two video conferencing sites equipped with basic, low-cost equipment, and staffed by a facilitator who can support and supervise students in both rooms. The changes allowed a small high school — within a city school system, and with just a handful of students needing more challenging work — to add nine advanced courses to its catalogue.\n\n\nEngaged partnerships\n\n\nOur most sustained, committed partnerships involve working with a school district on providing programming for students — jointly creating curriculum for a STEM-focused school or jointly seeking grant opportunities to expand educational opportunities. Burke County Public Schools have created a concentrated hub for high school and community college STEM offerings. Together, we have worked to garner grant funding for the school district to supplement NCSSM’s free offerings with paid programs, including a number of advanced classes. As part of this engaged partnership, Burke County teachers commit to offering feedback on the course materials over time.\n \nNCSSM provides interactive video conference courses to schools across North Carolina, a flexible and cost-effective solution for offering advanced STEM courses. ","blockGroups":{"main":{"blocks":[{"type":"rightColumn","id":"228729065227124521"}]},"main_228729065227124521_col1":{"blocks":[{"type":"box","id":"156363151447101102"}]},"main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main":{"blocks":[{"type":"oneColumn","id":"577345811982603857"},{"type":"twoColumn","id":"782356279288708642"}]}},"main_306323492258499741_banner":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_306323492258499741_banner","items":[{"image":{"items":[{"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w427881471536630797","ids":["10013641981083927"],"extras":{"10013641981083927":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"10013641981083927","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-10-23T16:59:05.450Z","name":"enrichments1","title":"enrichments1","extension":"jpg","md5":"372692dc6e2a29a3847ab8153add0d63","width":2592,"height":1936,"searchText":"enrichments1 enrichments1 none stem enrichments nc public schools none jpg images jpeg lisa watts","landscape":true,"ownerId":"26034325849012107","description":"","credit":"","tags":["stem enrichments","nc public schools"],"private":false,"crops":[{"top":"128","left":"20","width":"2572","height":"1353"}],"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]}],"type":"area","slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_306323492258499741_banner.items.0.image"},"color":"navy","header":"Boosting the bandwidth \nof North Carolina&#39;s\npublic schools","buttonText":"","linkType":"internal","pageId":null,"link":null,"type":"banner"}],"type":"area"},"rightColumn":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:rightColumn","items":[{"header":"NC Public Schools","pageId":"656346013569461500","type":"sectionContents"},{"stat":"Ready to partner?","body":"Email partnership@ncssm.edu","caption":"","color":"purple","linkType":"external","pageId":null,"link":"mailto:partnership@ncssm.edu","type":"facts"},{"widget":true,"editView":"1","type":"people","id":"w79678575592491457","limitByTag":1,"limit":5,"by":"id","tags":[],"ids":["857591570159856830"],"_snippets":[{"_id":"857591570159856830","type":"person","groupIds":["831287658225102007","842481420321129398","23684999650108280","907495999926272819"],"firstName":"Melissa","lastName":"Thibault","title":"Melissa Thibault","email":"thibault@ncssm.edu","phone":"919-416-2877","departmentIds":["56576487717205951"],"jobTitle":"Vice Chancellor for Distance Education and Extended Programs","building":"ETC","office":"","slug":"melissa-thibault","featuredImage":{"items":[],"type":"area","slug":"melissa-thibault:featuredImage"},"thumbnail":{"items":[{"limit":1,"aspectRatio":[1,1],"itemType":{"widget":true,"label":"Image(s)","icon":"icon-image","css":"slideshow"},"widget":true,"type":"slideshow","ids":["60038974564404989"],"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"extras":{"60038974564404989":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":2,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}},"position":"middle","size":"full","id":"w514059786593576562","_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"60038974564404989","length":13630,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-11-12T15:28:49.684Z","name":"thibault-melissa660","title":"thibault melissa660","extension":"jpg","md5":"cd80044ff49f23f65c209a7950f93a6c","width":172,"height":228,"searchText":"thibault melissa660 thibault melissa660 none none jpg images jpeg none","portrait":true,"ownerId":"anon-undefined","crops":[{"top":"2","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"},{"top":"28","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"}],"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":2,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"melissa-thibault:thumbnail"},"body":"Melissa Rihm Thibault leads the school in online learning, delivery of instruction using interactive video conferencing, teacher professional development, and student enrichment programs, including the statewide Summer Ventures in Math and Science pre-college research experience program.

His students work in small groups, their desks turned to face each other. In a moment they will begin a timed measurement of temperature, then use exponential functions to create a mathematical model for the data collected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wickham is an 18-year classroom veteran, the last five at VCHS. The previous 13 years he taught at some of the top high schools in his native Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Durham, a 40-minute drive down I-85, veteran North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics teacher Maria Hernandez observes Wickham’s classroom via interactive videoconference in the school’s distance learning studios. On one monitor is a wide view of Wickham’s class. Another, which replicates what Wickham’s class sees, displays Hernandez’s teaching materials. Other monitors contain additional views and teaching resources. Studio lights illuminate her against a green screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez describes herself as “a guest” in Wickham’s class, invited several times each week into his and other precalculus classrooms across the state as a teaching partner in an effort to lay the groundwork for a new approach to teacher leadership in hard-to-staff schools and subjects. This pilot was initiated by Public Impact, a Chapel Hill-based research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public Impact created Opportunity Culture, an initiative to restructure pre-K–12 schools to extend the reach of excellent teachers, principals, and their teams to more students, for more pay, within recurring school budgets. The foundation of Opportunity Culture is the multi-classroom leader, or MCL, an excellent teacher who leads a small teaching team while continuing to teach. The MCL provides guidance and frequent on-the-job coaching, co-planning, co-teaching, and modeling of instruction. In 2018–19 alone, Opportunity Culture reached more than 55,000 students in 300 schools over nine states, and more than 1,800 teachers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public Impact had developed the idea of “Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership” -- an MCL leading a team of teachers located elsewhere -- as a way to provide teacher-leaders for hard-to-staff schools and subjects. But the mechanics of the idea needed testing before being fully prototyped within Opportunity Culture. With funding from the College Board, Public Impact partnered with NCSSM to do just that. How could a remotely located MCL connect successfully with teachers and students? How would the technology work? How could an MCL and teachers in several schools schedule the time needed to plan, collaborate and teach together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result was the creation of Hernandez’s role. So far, it’s going great -- so NCSSM and Public Impact are now exploring how to offer remotely located multi-classroom leaders to other school districts throughout the state using Opportunity Culture’s full design. The financially efficient approach seems hard to beat, expanding access while losing none of its academic zip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez addresses Wickham’s class as though she were in the room. “I’d like you to make a conjecture,” she says, “about what the temperature will be over the course of this time frame.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“When we are through collecting the data,” Wickham adds in Henderson, “we will compare it to what you thought it would be, and we will see if you were right or wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez turns to her own instrumentation where she is running the same experiment. “This is cool,” she says to the students at Vance High.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Here we go,” Wickham says and begins the project timer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Math is a passion for Wickham. At Vance County High School, he teaches, or has taught, Math 1, Math 3, Advanced Functions and Modeling, and AP Calculus AB, as well as precal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“My brain is always working where math is concerned,” Wickham says. “It just has me engaged. That’s why I love it so much. And I want my students to see that it’s not just random numbers that we put in a calculator and get an answer. I just want them to make sense of it on a daily basis and see that it’s applicable in real-life situations.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though experienced at well-respected schools back home, Wickham’s curiosity about the education systems in more developed countries led him to the United States through an international teacher program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same sense of curiosity sparked his interest in working with a remotely located MCL, which he learned about through Vance County’s curriculum specialist. Many schools in Vance are already using full Multi-Classroom Leadership with in-person MCLs. But teachers in advanced high school classes often do not have enough peers to form a team within a school, much less to have a team leader. NCSSM’s role in the partnership was especially intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the credentials of the pilot’s partners, Wickham approached it with a wait-and-see attitude. His uncertainty evaporated upon meeting the “well-learned” team members. His greatest enthusiasm is reserved for Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve learned so much,” he says, “especially from Maria, in terms of questioning techniques, giving students time to collaborate, [and] the feedback she has given. I’m implementing all of that feedback into the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wickham isn’t the only one gaining new skills. He points to increases in his students’ confidence with the subject matter. “I have seen where quite a number of them really have grown in that they are more expressive,” he says. “They will take time to discuss the problems with their fellow classmates, and they are willing to share their thoughts and ideas about how they arrived at a certain solution. That’s a very good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The timed portion of the experiment complete, Hernandez asks the students to consider their original guess. “How does the data you collected compare with your conjecture? Take a minute to talk to your neighbor about this.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wickham discovers that one of the students, Hunter, accurately predicted what the final results would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez is enthused. “As mathematicians,” she says to the class, “people often want you to make predictions. If you can become skilled at that, just like we’ve done here today, then you can become very valuable and sought after.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The data leads to an exponential function. With a stylus and her laptop, Hernandez leads students into an equation, then turns it over to the students to complete. Wickham dives in, moving through his class to lend guidance where needed. A student named Maya hesitantly approaches the camera to work directly with Hernandez. Sharing their work with each other, they together solve the equation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez congratulates her. “You did such great work!” she says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maya smiles, her head dipping slightly with shy pride. “Thank you,” she says, and drifts back to her seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 10:40 Wickham wraps up his class. Students gather their books, slide back from their desks. “You did a fine job today,” Hernandez tells them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Says Wickham, “They did very well on this, I agree.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The monitors in Durham go dark, and Hernandez slides back from her own desk. “I really see a lot of similarities between these students in Mr. Wickham’s class and the students we have here from counties like Vance,” Hernandez says. “These equations are not easy. They’re doing some really powerful math. I can show you video of this class from the beginning of this semester to now, and the growth is just incredible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And Mr. Wickham,” she adds, smiling, “he’s really incredible, too.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fortunate connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM owes its role in the test of Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership to Grayson Cooper, a 2008 graduate of NCSSM and senior consultant with Public Impact. He is also the co-founder of ENC STEM, a non-profit focused on providing disadvantaged high school students in eastern North Carolina with “high quality STEM learning opportunities and leadership training.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cooper’s knowledge of the challenges facing rural students and teachers is personal; he grew up in a small, rural community tucked just inside the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. After graduating from college, he taught math for three years through Teach For America in northeastern North Carolina, a region dotted with tiny schools and school districts critically short of resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges faced by such districts, they’re filled with talent, just like their better-resourced brethren. When a district doesn’t have an appropriate person to lead as an MCL in a specialized subject, teachers still have the same potential -- they just need a supportive team leader. “Opportunity Culture is really about trusting great teachers and trusting their judgement to know what works best for their students,” Cooper says of the program. “It’s about having them take on roles where they have the autonomy, the authority, and the resources to be able to implement the change that they see is needed within their schools. I really wish that I had had that sort of support when I started teaching.” Public Impact has heard in many interviews of Opportunity Culture educators how even veteran teachers appreciate that support and collaboration as they focus on being lifelong learners themselves,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public Impact had been considering the possibility of adding remotely located MCLs to the mix since Opportunity Culture’s inception in 2009, well before Cooper joined the organization. The idea of partnering with NCCSM to make it happen gained traction once Cooper came onboard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It was a situation of ‘College Board is interested in this, we’re (Public Impact) interested in this, who can we get to partner?’” Cooper says. “That’s where my status as an NCSSM alum and working really closely with the school for a number of years worked out really well.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took two years to align all the moving parts, but the effort paid off. “Being able to hit the ground running with Science and Math, which has such good relationships and infrastructure across the state, was really crucial to this project being a success,” Cooper says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math is math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley Knox, a fourth-year math teacher at New Bern High School, also joined the pilot as a team teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Raised and educated in eastern North Carolina, Knox is at home among her students. Her love of numbers led to a master’s in math from East Carolina University, and then to New Bern High, where she teaches Math II (honors), Math III and precalculus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez is again in the classroom, the 140 miles between New Bern and Durham erased by the real-time connection between NCSSM and Knox’s Wednesday morning precal class. The same precalculus principles that applied on Monday morning at Vance County High also apply this morning in Knox’s classroom. Math is math, no matter where you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Graphing sine and cosine is the day’s challenge. Hernandez pulls up a video of a young girl on a park swing. It’s her daughter, Olivia. She swings back and forth, hair in her face one moment, flowing behind her the next. Two orange traffic cones mark a spot in front of and behind her. The laughter of children off-camera rises and falls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to think about her horizontal and vertical position,” Hernandez says. “What do you notice? What do you wonder? Think about this like mathematicians. Turn to your neighbor and talk with them about what it might have to do with trigonometric functions.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The class hums with multiple conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knox winds through the room, looking for signs of creative, mathematical thought. Satisfied with her students’ progress, Knox says, “I think they’re ready now, Mrs. H.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What did you notice?” Hernandez asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Hunter, you and Cole had a good conversation going,” Knox says. “Tell us what you noticed.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Each time she goes back and forth is one cycle,” Hunter says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez graphs the student input. A few minutes later she runs an animation showing Olivia’s motion as data points. She ties it all back into sine and cosine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay, now I want you guys to find a model for the horizontal and vertical position of the swinger,” she says. “Think about trigonometric functions and transformation functions.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knox takes over, leading her kids through their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A student approaches the camera and shows Maria her work. She’s found a truly unique way to solve a problem. “That’s great!” Hernandez says. “I’ve been teaching a hundred years and that’s the first time I’ve seen that. That’s great!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Wickham, Knox was drawn to joining Hernandez’s team due to NCSSM’s involvement. “I‘ve always been very curious about that school and how students learn there,” Knox says, “so I thought of this more as a partnership where they can see what it’s like with everyday students ... and we can continue to challenge our honors students into becoming ready for AP Calculus, or even beyond. It’s been a great experience involving more of the modeling instead of what I normally do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The collaborative spirit among the team teachers has been incredible, Knox points out. In addition to using materials shared with participants by NCSSM, the teachers themselves have worked together to build resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“A lot of the time teachers don’t have resources available to them through their school,” Knox says, “so I think it’s nice that we have this cohort of teachers helping each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much to gain from collaboration. The students gain as well as the teachers gain. Education is a constant change, and so teaching has to be a constant change, too.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“She’s kind of a mover and a shaker,” Hernandez says of Knox. “She’s been really good about trying to grow as a teacher [and] she really likes to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;"},{"widget":true,"editView":"1","type":"slideshow","id":"w56899370471497974","ids":["287472149577740791"],"extras":{"287472149577740791":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":17,"_items":[{"_id":"287472149577740791","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2019-05-24T13:07:51.771Z","name":"img-3762-donaldson-wickham","title":"Sarah Donaldson and Stanford Wickham participate in remotely located MCL program","extension":"jpg","md5":"de9314f700cb35193429f718207cd384","width":5184,"height":3456,"searchText":"img 3762 donaldson wickham sarah donaldson and stanford wickham participate in remotely located mcl program none public impact opportunity culture math deep none jpg images jpeg beatrice moss","landscape":true,"ownerId":"572443527334305089","description":"","credit":"","tags":["public impact","opportunity culture","math","deep"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]},{"type":"richText","content":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustaining and growing Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this semester, NCSSM used temporary grant funds to cover pilot expenses, including the remotely located MCL’s salary. But one of the five Opportunity Culture Principles is that MCL roles -- including extra pay -- are funded through reallocations of regular school budgets so they can be sustained over time without grants. Public Impact’s routine work with Opportunity Culture schools includes working with teams of teachers and administrators to make budget reallocation decisions that fit each school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Melissa Thibault, NCSSM’s Vice Chancellor for Distance Education and Extended Programs, is eager to continue the school’s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We want to keep doing it, we have the will to do it, and we have identified some areas where we can continue to build capacity within some of the schools that we are working with,” Thibault says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’d love to continue working with Public Impact on this,” she says. “There’s a lot of mission alignment between their organization and ours. We have here the teaching expertise and the IVC infrastructure to connect with partner schools, but Public Impact is the organization with the relationships and the management capacity and the product.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thibault believes so strongly in the program that she and her colleagues at NCSSM are eager to collaborate with Public Impact on a design for future scale and sustainability. “This is one way that we can retain talent and magnify the impact of great teachers,” she says. “That, to me, is at the heart of why this is an important program.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give and receive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of the semester, Hernandez will have the good fortune to continue working alongside Knox, Wickham, and the other teachers on the team -- Corrette Miller at Lexington Senior High School in Lexington, Sarah Donaldson at North Pitt High School in Bethel, and Jocelyn Thammavong, a teammate of Ashley Knox’s at New Bern High. In every instance, the project stands as an incredible example of how public and private partners can leverage their strengths to extend to students statewide the knowledge and skills they need to live their best lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We have a great group of teachers who signed up to do this because they wanted to grow as professionals,” Hernandez says.“I learn so much from them, too. The opportunity both to work with the students and work with the teachers is really valuable. It’s really something that, I think, is a rare occasion for us.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To learn more about NCSSM’s work with the Opportunity Culture initiative, check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a

course of this time frame when we are through collecting the data wickham adds in henderson we will compare it to what you thought it would be and we will see if you were right or wrong hernandez turns to her own instrumentation where she is running the same experiment this is cool she says to the students at vance high here we go wickham says and begins the project timer math is a passion for wickham at vance county high school he teaches or has taught math 1 math 3 advanced functions and modeling and ap calculus ab as well as precal my brain is always working where math is concerned wickham says it just has me engaged that s why i love it so much and i want my students to see that it s not just random numbers that we put in a calculator and get an answer i just want them to make sense of it on a daily basis and see that it s applicable in real life situations though experienced at well respected schools back home wickham s curiosity about the education systems in more developed countries led him to the united states through an international teacher program that same sense of curiosity sparked his interest in working with a remotely located mcl which he learned about through vance county s curriculum specialist many schools in vance are already using full multi classroom leadership with in person mcls but teachers in advanced high school classes often do not have enough peers to form a team within a school much less to have a team leader ncssm s role in the partnership was especially intriguing despite the credentials of the pilot s partners wickham approached it with a wait and see attitude his uncertainty evaporated upon meeting the well learned team members his greatest enthusiasm is reserved for hernandez i ve learned so much he says especially from maria in terms of questioning techniques giving students time to collaborate and the feedback she has given i m implementing all of that feedback into the classroom wickham isn t the only one gaining new skills he points to increases in his students confidence with the subject matter i have seen where quite a number of them really have grown in that they are more expressive he says they will take time to discuss the problems with their fellow classmates and they are willing to share their thoughts and ideas about how they arrived at a certain solution that s a very good thing the timed portion of the experiment complete hernandez asks the students to consider their original guess how does the data you collected compare with your conjecture take a minute to talk to your neighbor about this wickham discovers that one of the students hunter accurately predicted what the final results would be hernandez is enthused as mathematicians she says to the class people often want you to make predictions if you can become skilled at that just like we ve done here today then you can become very valuable and sought after the data leads to an exponential function with a stylus and her laptop hernandez leads students into an equation then turns it over to the students to complete wickham dives in moving through his class to lend guidance where needed a student named maya hesitantly approaches the camera to work directly with hernandez sharing their work with each other they together solve the equation hernandez congratulates her you did such great work she says maya smiles her head dipping slightly with shy pride thank you she says and drifts back to her seat at 10 40 wickham wraps up his class students gather their books slide back from their desks you did a fine job today hernandez tells them says wickham they did very well on this i agree the monitors in durham go dark and hernandez slides back from her own desk i really see a lot of similarities between these students in mr wickham s class and the students we have here from counties like vance hernandez says these equations are not easy they re doing some really powerful math i can show you video of this class from the beginning of this semester to now and the growth is just incredible and mr wickham she adds smiling he s really incredible too a fortunate connection ncssm owes its role in the test of remotely located multi classroom leadership to grayson cooper a 2008 graduate of ncssm and senior consultant with public impact he is also the co founder of enc stem a non profit focused on providing disadvantaged high school students in eastern north carolina with high quality stem learning opportunities and leadership training cooper s knowledge of the challenges facing rural students and teachers is personal he grew up in a small rural community tucked just inside the nantahala national forest in western north carolina after graduating from college he taught math for three years through teach for america in northeastern north carolina a region dotted with tiny schools and school districts critically short of resources despite the challenges faced by such districts they re filled with talent just like their better resourced brethren when a district doesn t have an appropriate person to lead as an mcl in a specialized subject teachers still have the same potential they just need a supportive team leader opportunity culture is really about trusting great teachers and trusting their judgement to know what works best for their students cooper says of the program it s about having them take on roles where they have the autonomy the authority and the resources to be able to implement the change that they see is needed within their schools i really wish that i had had that sort of support when i started teaching public impact has heard in many interviews of opportunity culture educators how even veteran teachers appreciate that support and collaboration as they focus on being lifelong learners themselves public impact had been considering the possibility of adding remotely located mcls to the mix since opportunity culture s inception in 2009 well before cooper joined the organization the idea of partnering with nccsm to make it happen gained traction once cooper came onboard it was a situation of college board is interested in this we re public impact interested in this who can we get to partner cooper says that s where my status as an ncssm alum and working really closely with the school for a number of years worked out really well it took two years to align all the moving parts but the effort paid off being able to hit the ground running with science and math which has such good relationships and infrastructure across the state was really crucial to this project being a success cooper says math is math ashley knox a fourth year math teacher at new bern high school also joined the pilot as a team teacher raised and educated in eastern north carolina knox is at home among her students her love of numbers led to a master s in math from east carolina university and then to new bern high where she teaches math ii honors math iii and precalculus hernandez is again in the classroom the 140 miles between new bern and durham erased by the real time connection between ncssm and knox s wednesday morning precal class the same precalculus principles that applied on monday morning at vance county high also apply this morning in knox s classroom math is math no matter where you are graphing sine and cosine is the day s challenge hernandez pulls up a video of a young girl on a park swing it s her daughter olivia she swings back and forth hair in her face one moment flowing behind her the next two orange traffic cones mark a spot in front of and behind her the laughter of children off camera rises and falls i want you to think about her horizontal and vertical position hernandez says what do you notice what do you wonder think about this like mathematicians turn to your neighbor and talk with them about what it might have to do with trigonometric functions the class hums with multiple conversations knox winds through the room looking for signs of creative mathematical thought satisfied with her students progress knox says i think they re ready now mrs h what did you notice hernandez asks hunter you and cole had a good conversation going knox says tell us what you noticed each time she goes back and forth is one cycle hunter says hernandez graphs the student input a few minutes later she runs an animation showing olivia s motion as data points she ties it all back into sine and cosine okay now i want you guys to find a model for the horizontal and vertical position of the swinger she says think about trigonometric functions and transformation functions knox takes over leading her kids through their calculations a student approaches the camera and shows maria her work she s found a truly unique way to solve a problem that s great hernandez says i ve been teaching a hundred years and that s the first time i ve seen that that s great like wickham knox was drawn to joining hernandez s team due to ncssm s involvement i ve always been very curious about that school and how students learn there knox says so i thought of this more as a partnership where they can see what it s like with everyday students and we can continue to challenge our honors students into becoming ready for ap calculus or even beyond it s been a great experience involving more of the modeling instead of what i normally do the collaborative spirit among the team teachers has been incredible knox points out in addition to using materials shared with participants by ncssm the teachers themselves have worked together to build resources a lot of the time teachers don t have resources available to them through their school knox says so i think it s nice that we have this cohort of teachers helping each other there s so much to gain from collaboration the students gain as well as the teachers gain education is a constant change and so teaching has to be a constant change too she s kind of a mover and a shaker hernandez says of knox she s been really good about trying to grow as a teacher and she really likes to learn sustaining and growing remotely located multi classroom leadership for this semester ncssm used temporary grant funds to cover pilot expenses including the remotely located mcl s salary but one of the five opportunity culture principles is that mcl roles including extra pay are funded through reallocations of regular school budgets so they can be sustained over time without grants public impact s routine work with opportunity culture schools includes working with teams of teachers and administrators to make budget reallocation decisions that fit each school melissa thibault ncssm s vice chancellor for distance education and extended programs is eager to continue the school s work we want to keep doing it we have the will to do it and we have identified some areas where we can continue to build capacity within some of the schools that we are working with thibault says we d love to continue working with public impact on this she says there s a lot of mission alignment between their organization and ours we have here the teaching expertise and the ivc infrastructure to connect with partner schools but public impact is the organization with the relationships and the management capacity and the product thibault believes so strongly in the program that she and her colleagues at ncssm are eager to collaborate with public impact on a design for future scale and sustainability this is one way that we can retain talent and magnify the impact of great teachers she says that to me is at the heart of why this is an important program give and receive for the remainder of the semester hernandez will have the good fortune to continue working alongside knox wickham and the other teachers on the team corrette miller at lexington senior high school in lexington sarah donaldson at north pitt high school in bethel and jocelyn thammavong a teammate of ashley knox s at new bern high in every instance the project stands as an incredible example of how public and private partners can leverage their strengths to extend to students statewide the knowledge and skills they need to live their best lives we have a great group of teachers who signed up to do this because they wanted to grow as professionals hernandez says i learn so much from them too the opportunity both to work with the students and work with the teachers is really valuable it s really something that i think is a rare occasion for us to learn more about ncssm s work with the opportunity culture initiative check out this video written by brian faircloth with contributions from public impact staff","searchSummary":"\nTeacher Stanford Wickham is busy with his Monday morning precalculus class of 14 students at Vance County High School, a few miles southeast of downtown Henderson. His students work in small groups, their desks turned to face each other. In a moment they will begin a timed measurement of temperature, then use exponential functions to create a mathematical model for the data collected.\n\n\nWickham is an 18-year classroom veteran, the last five at VCHS. The previous 13 years he taught at some of the top high schools in his native Jamaica.\n\n\nIn Durham, a 40-minute drive down I-85, veteran North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics teacher Maria Hernandez observes Wickham’s classroom via interactive videoconference in the school’s distance learning studios. On one monitor is a wide view of Wickham’s class. Another, which replicates what Wickham’s class sees, displays Hernandez’s teaching materials. Other monitors contain additional views and teaching resources. Studio lights illuminate her against a green screen.\n\n\nHernandez describes herself as “a guest” in Wickham’s class, invited several times each week into his and other precalculus classrooms across the state as a teaching partner in an effort to lay the groundwork for a new approach to teacher leadership in hard-to-staff schools and subjects. This pilot was initiated by Public Impact, a Chapel Hill-based research and consulting firm.\n\n\nPublic Impact created Opportunity Culture, an initiative to restructure pre-K–12 schools to extend the reach of excellent teachers, principals, and their teams to more students, for more pay, within recurring school budgets. The foundation of Opportunity Culture is the multi-classroom leader, or MCL, an excellent teacher who leads a small teaching team while continuing to teach. The MCL provides guidance and frequent on-the-job coaching, co-planning, co-teaching, and modeling of instruction. In 2018–19 alone, Opportunity Culture reached more than 55,000 students in 300 schools over nine states, and more than 1,800 teachers.\n\n\nPublic Impact had developed the idea of “Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership” -- an MCL leading a team of teachers located elsewhere -- as a way to provide teacher-leaders for hard-to-staff schools and subjects. But the mechanics of the idea needed testing before being fully prototyped within Opportunity Culture. With funding from the College Board, Public Impact partnered with NCSSM to do just that. How could a remotely located MCL connect successfully with teachers and students? How would the technology work? How could an MCL and teachers in several schools schedule the time needed to plan, collaborate and teach together?\n\n\nThe result was the creation of Hernandez’s role. So far, it’s going great -- so NCSSM and Public Impact are now exploring how to offer remotely located multi-classroom leaders to other school districts throughout the state using Opportunity Culture’s full design. The financially efficient approach seems hard to beat, expanding access while losing none of its academic zip.\n\n\nHernandez addresses Wickham’s class as though she were in the room. “I’d like you to make a conjecture,” she says, “about what the temperature will be over the course of this time frame.”\n\n\n“When we are through collecting the data,” Wickham adds in Henderson, “we will compare it to what you thought it would be, and we will see if you were right or wrong.”\n\n\nHernandez turns to her own instrumentation where she is running the same experiment. “This is cool,” she says to the students at Vance High.\n\n\n“Here we go,” Wickham says and begins the project timer.\n\n\nMath is a passion for Wickham. At Vance County High School, he teaches, or has taught, Math 1, Math 3, Advanced Functions and Modeling, and AP Calculus AB, as well as precal.\n\n\n“My brain is always working where math is concerned,” Wickham says. “It just has me engaged. That’s why I love it so much. And I want my students to see that it’s not just random numbers that we put in a calculator and get an answer. I just want them to make sense of it on a daily basis and see that it’s applicable in real-life situations.”\n\n\nThough experienced at well-respected schools back home, Wickham’s curiosity about the education systems in more developed countries led him to the United States through an international teacher program.\n\n\nThat same sense of curiosity sparked his interest in working with a remotely located MCL, which he learned about through Vance County’s curriculum specialist. Many schools in Vance are already using full Multi-Classroom Leadership with in-person MCLs. But teachers in advanced high school classes often do not have enough peers to form a team within a school, much less to have a team leader. NCSSM’s role in the partnership was especially intriguing.\n\n\nDespite the credentials of the pilot’s partners, Wickham approached it with a wait-and-see attitude. His uncertainty evaporated upon meeting the “well-learned” team members. His greatest enthusiasm is reserved for Hernandez.\n\n\n“I’ve learned so much,” he says, “especially from Maria, in terms of questioning techniques, giving students time to collaborate, [and] the feedback she has given. I’m implementing all of that feedback into the classroom.”\n\n\nWickham isn’t the only one gaining new skills. He points to increases in his students’ confidence with the subject matter. “I have seen where quite a number of them really have grown in that they are more expressive,” he says. “They will take time to discuss the problems with their fellow classmates, and they are willing to share their thoughts and ideas about how they arrived at a certain solution. That’s a very good thing.”\n\n\nThe timed portion of the experiment complete, Hernandez asks the students to consider their original guess. “How does the data you collected compare with your conjecture? Take a minute to talk to your neighbor about this.”\n\n\nWickham discovers that one of the students, Hunter, accurately predicted what the final results would be.\n\n\nHernandez is enthused. “As mathematicians,” she says to the class, “people often want you to make predictions. If you can become skilled at that, just like we’ve done here today, then you can become very valuable and sought after.”\n\n\nThe data leads to an exponential function. With a stylus and her laptop, Hernandez leads students into an equation, then turns it over to the students to complete. Wickham dives in, moving through his class to lend guidance where needed. A student named Maya hesitantly approaches the camera to work directly with Hernandez. Sharing their work with each other, they together solve the equation.\n\n\nHernandez congratulates her. “You did such great work!” she says.\n\n\nMaya smiles, her head dipping slightly with shy pride. “Thank you,” she says, and drifts back to her seat.\n\n\nAt 10:40 Wickham wraps up his class. Students gather their books, slide back from their desks. “You did a fine job today,” Hernandez tells them.\n\n\nSays Wickham, “They did very well on this, I agree.”\n\n\nThe monitors in Durham go dark, and Hernandez slides back from her own desk. “I really see a lot of similarities between these students in Mr. Wickham’s class and the students we have here from counties like Vance,” Hernandez says. “These equations are not easy. They’re doing some really powerful math. I can show you video of this class from the beginning of this semester to now, and the growth is just incredible.\n\n\n“And Mr. Wickham,” she adds, smiling, “he’s really incredible, too.”\n\n\n \n\n\nA fortunate connection\n\n\nNCSSM owes its role in the test of Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership to Grayson Cooper, a 2008 graduate of NCSSM and senior consultant with Public Impact. He is also the co-founder of ENC STEM, a non-profit focused on providing disadvantaged high school students in eastern North Carolina with “high quality STEM learning opportunities and leadership training.”\n\n\nCooper’s knowledge of the challenges facing rural students and teachers is personal; he grew up in a small, rural community tucked just inside the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. After graduating from college, he taught math for three years through Teach For America in northeastern North Carolina, a region dotted with tiny schools and school districts critically short of resources.\n\n\nDespite the challenges faced by such districts, they’re filled with talent, just like their better-resourced brethren. When a district doesn’t have an appropriate person to lead as an MCL in a specialized subject, teachers still have the same potential -- they just need a supportive team leader. “Opportunity Culture is really about trusting great teachers and trusting their judgement to know what works best for their students,” Cooper says of the program. “It’s about having them take on roles where they have the autonomy, the authority, and the resources to be able to implement the change that they see is needed within their schools. I really wish that I had had that sort of support when I started teaching.” Public Impact has heard in many interviews of Opportunity Culture educators how even veteran teachers appreciate that support and collaboration as they focus on being lifelong learners themselves,\n\n\nPublic Impact had been considering the possibility of adding remotely located MCLs to the mix since Opportunity Culture’s inception in 2009, well before Cooper joined the organization. The idea of partnering with NCCSM to make it happen gained traction once Cooper came onboard.\n\n\n“It was a situation of ‘College Board is interested in this, we’re (Public Impact) interested in this, who can we get to partner?’” Cooper says. “That’s where my status as an NCSSM alum and working really closely with the school for a number of years worked out really well.”\n\n\nIt took two years to align all the moving parts, but the effort paid off. “Being able to hit the ground running with Science and Math, which has such good relationships and infrastructure across the state, was really crucial to this project being a success,” Cooper says.\n\n\n \n\n\nMath is math\n\n\nAshley Knox, a fourth-year math teacher at New Bern High School, also joined the pilot as a team teacher.\n\n\nRaised and educated in eastern North Carolina, Knox is at home among her students. Her love of numbers led to a master’s in math from East Carolina University, and then to New Bern High, where she teaches Math II (honors), Math III and precalculus.\n\n\nHernandez is again in the classroom, the 140 miles between New Bern and Durham erased by the real-time connection between NCSSM and Knox’s Wednesday morning precal class. The same precalculus principles that applied on Monday morning at Vance County High also apply this morning in Knox’s classroom. Math is math, no matter where you are.\n\n\nGraphing sine and cosine is the day’s challenge. Hernandez pulls up a video of a young girl on a park swing. It’s her daughter, Olivia. She swings back and forth, hair in her face one moment, flowing behind her the next. Two orange traffic cones mark a spot in front of and behind her. The laughter of children off-camera rises and falls.\n\n\n“I want you to think about her horizontal and vertical position,” Hernandez says. “What do you notice? What do you wonder? Think about this like mathematicians. Turn to your neighbor and talk with them about what it might have to do with trigonometric functions.”\n\n\nThe class hums with multiple conversations.\n\n\nKnox winds through the room, looking for signs of creative, mathematical thought. Satisfied with her students’ progress, Knox says, “I think they’re ready now, Mrs. H.”\n\n\n“What did you notice?” Hernandez asks.\n\n\n“Hunter, you and Cole had a good conversation going,” Knox says. “Tell us what you noticed.”\n\n\n“Each time she goes back and forth is one cycle,” Hunter says.\n\n\nHernandez graphs the student input. A few minutes later she runs an animation showing Olivia’s motion as data points. She ties it all back into sine and cosine.\n\n\n“Okay, now I want you guys to find a model for the horizontal and vertical position of the swinger,” she says. “Think about trigonometric functions and transformation functions.”\n\n\nKnox takes over, leading her kids through their calculations.\n\n\nA student approaches the camera and shows Maria her work. She’s found a truly unique way to solve a problem. “That’s great!” Hernandez says. “I’ve been teaching a hundred years and that’s the first time I’ve seen that. That’s great!”\n\n\nLike Wickham, Knox was drawn to joining Hernandez’s team due to NCSSM’s involvement. “I‘ve always been very curious about that school and how students learn there,” Knox says, “so I thought of this more as a partnership where they can see what it’s like with everyday students ... and we can continue to challenge our honors students into becoming ready for AP Calculus, or even beyond. It’s been a great experience involving more of the modeling instead of what I normally do.”\n\n\nThe collaborative spirit among the team teachers has been incredible, Knox points out. In addition to using materials shared with participants by NCSSM, the teachers themselves have worked together to build resources.\n\n\n“A lot of the time teachers don’t have resources available to them through their school,” Knox says, “so I think it’s nice that we have this cohort of teachers helping each other.\n\n\n“There’s so much to gain from collaboration. The students gain as well as the teachers gain. Education is a constant change, and so teaching has to be a constant change, too.”\n\n\n“She’s kind of a mover and a shaker,” Hernandez says of Knox. “She’s been really good about trying to grow as a teacher [and] she really likes to learn.” \nSustaining and growing Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership\n\n\nFor this semester, NCSSM used temporary grant funds to cover pilot expenses, including the remotely located MCL’s salary. But one of the five Opportunity Culture Principles is that MCL roles -- including extra pay -- are funded through reallocations of regular school budgets so they can be sustained over time without grants. Public Impact’s routine work with Opportunity Culture schools includes working with teams of teachers and administrators to make budget reallocation decisions that fit each school.\n\n\nMelissa Thibault, NCSSM’s Vice Chancellor for Distance Education and Extended Programs, is eager to continue the school’s work.\n\n\n“We want to keep doing it, we have the will to do it, and we have identified some areas where we can continue to build capacity within some of the schools that we are working with,” Thibault says.\n\n\n“We’d love to continue working with Public Impact on this,” she says. “There’s a lot of mission alignment between their organization and ours. We have here the teaching expertise and the IVC infrastructure to connect with partner schools, but Public Impact is the organization with the relationships and the management capacity and the product.”\n\n\nThibault believes so strongly in the program that she and her colleagues at NCSSM are eager to collaborate with Public Impact on a design for future scale and sustainability. “This is one way that we can retain talent and magnify the impact of great teachers,” she says. “That, to me, is at the heart of why this is an important program.”\n\n\n \n\n\nGive and receive\n\n\nFor the remainder of the semester, Hernandez will have the good fortune to continue working alongside Knox, Wickham, and the other teachers on the team -- Corrette Miller at Lexington Senior High School in Lexington, Sarah Donaldson at North Pitt High School in Bethel, and Jocelyn Thammavong, a teammate of Ashley Knox’s at New Bern High. In every instance, the project stands as an incredible example of how public and private partners can leverage their strengths to extend to students statewide the knowledge and skills they need to live their best lives.\n\n\n“We have a great group of teachers who signed up to do this because they wanted to grow as professionals,” Hernandez says.“I learn so much from them, too.

subject areas. It&#39;s a low- to no-cost way to support your STEM goals and offer advanced coursework to smaller groups of students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Affiliate partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our affiliate partnerships, we provide interactive video conferencing enrichment sessions to a district’s students and/or district-specific teacher professional development sessions. Students and teachers from &lt;strong&gt;Greene County Schools&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, regularly attend events and workshops such as our Ethics and Leadership Conference at NCSSM’s Durham campus. Greene County teachers also make use of videos and other digital assets and interactive video conference offerings to enrich their current class materials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Cooperative partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through cooperative partnerships, we provide courses for credit to students through interactive video conferencing. The &lt;strong&gt;Mt. Airy City Schools&lt;/strong&gt; superintendent and high school staff, for example, turned one classroom into two video conferencing sites equipped with basic, low-cost equipment, and staffed by a facilitator who can support and supervise students in both rooms. The changes allowed a small high school — within a city school system, and with just a handful of students needing more challenging work — to add nine advanced courses to its catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Engaged partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our most sustained, committed partnerships involve working with a school district on providing programming for students — jointly creating curriculum for a STEM-focused school or jointly seeking grant opportunities to expand educational opportunities. &lt;strong&gt;Burke County Public Schools&lt;/strong&gt; have created a concentrated hub for high school and community college STEM offerings. Together, we have worked to garner grant funding for the school district to supplement NCSSM’s free offerings with paid programs, including a number of advanced classes. As part of this engaged partnership, Burke County teachers commit to offering feedback on the course materials over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"}],"type":"area"},"main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col2":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col2","items":[{"type":"richText","content":"&lt;p&gt;NCSSM provides interactive video conference courses to schools across North Carolina, a flexible and cost-effective solution for offering advanced STEM courses. &lt;/p&gt;"},{"text":"9th-12th grade courses","linkType":"external","pageId":"818690342908236260","link":"http://uniapp.ncssm.edu/registrar/catalog/ivc_courses.php","color":"btn-info","size":"btn-lg","width":"btn-fit","type":"button"}],"type":"area"},"main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col1":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col1","items":[{"editView":"1","widget":true,"type":"slideshow","id":"w895289603486725374","ids":["369315775243836253"],"extras":{"369315775243836253":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"369315775243836253","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-10-29T19:44:23.191Z","name":"img-3671-x2","title":"Garrett Love teaching IVC class","extension":"jpg","md5":"0b67896d022f5efc501de828430da36c","width":1280,"height":854,"searchText":"img 3671 x2 garrett love teaching ivc class none garrett love teaching instructors ivc distance education none jpg images jpeg sophie williams","landscape":true,"ownerId":"471213998808079838","description":"","credit":"","tags":["garrett love","teaching","instructors","ivc","distance education"],"private":false,"crops":[{"top":"3","left":"58","width":"1104","height":"844"},{"top":"13","left":"206","width":"914","height":"841"},{"top":"17","left":"249","width":"924","height":"821"},{"top":"10","left":"564","width":"716","height":"844"},{"top":"12","left":"12","width":"1220","height":"706"},{"top":"0","left":"422","width":"858","height":"790"}],"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]}],"type":"area"}}},{"id":"866518575441696049","sectionTitle":"Support NCSSM","pageId":"801194674202421804","description":"Make a gift to the NCSSM Foundation, or get involved.

founders — former North Carolina Governor James B. Hunt Jr.; former North Carolina governor, senator and Duke University president Terry Sanford; and academician and author John Ehle — envisioned an institution that would invest in the state&#39;s human and intellectual capital to build leadership and economic progress.\n\n\nIn 1980, during Governor Hunt&#39;s first administration, North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics opened on the grounds of the former Watts Hospital in Durham with 150 high school juniors. It was the first school of its kind — a public, residential high school welcoming students from across the state to study a specialized curriculum emphasizing science and mathematics but also offering humanities courses, athletics, and extracurricular opportunities.\n\n\nThe founders&#39; early vision has matured into a vital institution that models and advocates for excellence in public education. In 2007, the school became the 17th constituent of the University of North Carolina system. \nNCSSM Alumni \nOpening opportunities for students from every corner of our state\n\n\nEach year we enroll talented students from all 13 congressional districts and nearly each of North Carolina&#39;s 100 counties. \nEvolving into an online resource and partner to teachers, school districts\n\n\nWe began as a residential school, but we&#39;ve grown to be so much more. During the 2014-2015 academic year, for the first time, more students were enrolled in NCSSM Online (720) than in our residential program (680). We also offer courses, professional development, and other resources for teachers and school districts across the state. \nNationally recognized, internationally admired\n\n\nFor nearly 15 years, Newsweek has ranked NCSSM as a top public high school in the country. The Washington Post also categorizes NCSSM as one of the top-performing high schools nationwide. A number of schools globally have modeled themselves after our school. \nProving North Carolina students can compete and win globally\n\n\nWithin the last 5 years, NCSSM students have won or placed in the Singapore International Mathematics Challenge, Conrad Spirit of Innovation Award, Moody’s Mathematics Challenge, and scores of other contests — a good sign for our state&#39;s economy and future. \nCultivating community, offering\n\nreal-world learning experiences\n\n\nWe require all students to complete 60 hours of service with a North Carolina nonprofit before their senior year.

Planning Process&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2016, North Carolina voters passed the Connect NC bond package which included $58 million to grow a second campus of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics in Morganton (NCSSM). Planning commenced in late-2016 with the hiring of an architectural firm, educational program design consultants, and a planning director. NCSSM will open its second campus in 2021 with an initial enrollment of 300 students.  A comprehensive dashboard is available below to review milestones and learn more about the planning timeline and process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duda|Paine Architects has been engaged as the architectural team and the William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at NC State University has been retained by NCSSM as the educational program design consultant.  Their work is being supported by the planning director and a core planning team of 23 alumni, educators, and partners in business and government.  The educational program vision and site recommendation will be presented to the NCSSM Board of Trustees in September 2017 for review and approval.

This included an overview of engagement activities connected to advanced planning from Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning at NCSSM; initial recommendations for the educational programmatic vision from Trip Stallings, Director of Policy Research at the Friday Institute; and a report of the site evaluation process from Darren Lathan, Senior Associate at Duda|Paine Architects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the western campus update, a formal recommendation of the site location in Morganton was presented to the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees approved the recommendation that the NCSSM-Morganton campus be located on the &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/cfiTKYxVGsI\"&gt;eastern ridge of the North Carolina School for the Deaf&lt;/a&gt;, a property currently managed by the state’s Department of Public Instruction. This decision follows months of research and on-site analysis by Duda|Paine Architects and resulting consensus that was achieved among members of the NCSSM Western Campus Core Planning Team. Chancellor Todd Roberts also endorsed the recommendation that advanced to the Board of Trustees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Today’s action by the NCSSM Board of Trustees represents a milestone for our institution,” says Tom Williams, Chair of the NCSSM Board of Trustees. “We are excited to continue our western campus planning efforts with an eye toward presenting the overall educational program vision in Morganton later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The proposed site was selected among three options that are each located within the 800-acres adjacent to I-40 and bordered by Burkemont Avenue, Fleming Drive, Sterling Street, and Enola Road. The eastern ridge of the North Carolina School for the Deaf emerged as the preferred location following an analysis of a multitude of factors to include safety and security, green space, and connectivity to downtown and educational partners. The recommendation was celebrated by members of the NCSSM community and partners across the state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today’s announcement is a positive next step for greater educational access for our citizens in the Unifour region of our state,” says Margaret Spellings, President of the University of North Carolina. “The creation of an NCSSM campus in western North Carolina will strengthen our efforts to deliver a world-class STEM education to many more of our state’s most talented students, and I applaud Chancellor Roberts and the members of the NCSSM Board of Trustees for their leadership and vision.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mark Johnson, North Carolina’s Superintendent of Public Instruction, agrees. “The expansion of NCSSM is exciting for students and families all across North Carolina,” says Johnson. “The western campus will provide more opportunities for students on one of the most beautiful settings in the entire state. I look forward to all the collaboration ahead for North Carolina students and educators at the western campus.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;State Representative Hugh Blackwell shares similar excitement about the project. “Having worked hard to bring a new North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics to Burke County and western North Carolina,” he says, “I am elated with the announcement that an actual building site for the new school has been identified. This puts us in excellent position to stay on schedule to admit the first students in fall 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Board of Trustees also received a draft report of the educational programmatic vision for the new campus during the meeting. The report includes a series of recommendations informed by thousands of recommendations that were shared through surveys, focus groups, design charrettes, and community events.

A &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus/dashboard\"&gt;comprehensive dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is available to review milestones and learn more about the planning timeline and process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Duda|Paine Architects has been engaged as the architectural team and the William and Ida Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at NC State University has been retained by NCSSM as the educational program design consultant.  Their work was supported by the director of western campus planning and a core planning team of 23 alumni, educators, and partners in business and government.  An overview of the advance planning process has been captured on &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3seEVxzAH7E\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=Ap9XufqtH0o\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;by NCSSM alumnus Caleb Owolabi &#39;11.  The educational program vision and site recommendation were presented to the NCSSM Board of Trustees in September 2017 and each was unanimously approved at that meeting.  The materials, as presented, are available below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgb1Jtbko5d1ItNkE\"&gt;Overall Project Summary: The Road to Morganton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgeTdQcVUxN0NIc2tQRnAyQUNKOVMwb2xKWUZF\"&gt;Educational Program Vision Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgXzRraUcwdHZjZ0RZYkN1ZmVHS1ZxUUpPTzZn\"&gt;Educational Program Vision Report - Executive Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgRThwN19zc21WNWc\"&gt;Master Plan Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-0KxrwTySqgS2VsU0hFLVRrLUU\"&gt;Master Plan Report - Executive Summary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW! &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_t_iJl8OnImaLFEjRXfg8j3iWgg-XHio/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;Final Report: NCSSM-Morganton Academic Steering Team &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW! &lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQhRwNsrVxi9l7IZ8oLfE5_VDFJuxznj/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;Final Report: NCSSM-Morganton Student Experience Steering Team &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are grateful for the support of North Carolina voters in passing the Connect NC bond package.

Having operated in the region since 1988, Case Farms is highly invested in the community and employs more than 1,000 people in the Morganton area. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Case Farms’ $100,000 gift will help fund the development of the new campus that will open in 2021 and provide a cutting-edge education for high schoolers from across the state. NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top faculty and mentors in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields with an added focus on data science.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“This new campus will help mentor the next generation of leaders and we are honored to support the school’s vision,” said Charles Rigdon, senior vice president of operations at Case Farms. “Case Farms knows the importance of education and we hope our donation will help provide opportunities for students in this community and across North Carolina for years to come.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM’s expansion to Morganton is generating new opportunities for people and businesses to partner with the institution to enable the innovative programming and infrastructure that is a hallmark of the NCSSM experience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We are so grateful for Case Farms’ investment in our new Morganton campus which is yet another example of the incredible support we are receiving from the local community,” said Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning for NCSSM. “We are thrilled to build our new campus in Morganton, not only bringing the promise of NCSSM to hundreds more students, but also serving as a catalyst for economic development in the region beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM is actively engaged in a capital campaign that includes a goal of raising $10 million in private donations to support the construction of the Morganton campus. To date, the NCSSM Foundation has recorded more than 250 gifts that total more than $7,000,000 in support of NCSSM’s emerging campus in Morganton. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the capital campaign, visit ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p style=\"text-align:center;\"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About NCSSM: &lt;/strong&gt;The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics is a world-class public high school with statewide reach offering students the skills and knowledge to design their own future.

At today’s groundbreaking event, Carolinas HealthCare System Blue Ridge presented a gift of $5 million, which conveys naming rights for a comprehensive student wellness and activities center to be built on the NCSSM-Morganton campus.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;CHS Blue Ridge’s $5 million gift represents a significant step toward the $10 million goal to complete construction of the new Morganton campus. This support is also representative of the growing number of donors who help sustain excellence, innovation, and achievement across our three campuses in Durham, Morganton, and Online. The groundbreaking ceremony for NCSSM-Morganton provided the perfect backdrop against which to celebrate this leadership gift among the many others that have made a major impact on our immediate needs and our plans for the future. Fundraising for the Morganton campus is one part of a larger comprehensive campaign that will expand the resources available for NCSSM’s statewide mission — including tens of millions of dollars in private and public investments for upgrades and improvements on the Durham campus.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;Our founders envisioned the NCSSM experience as one of many opportunities. Our expansion into Online and now to Morganton underscores that there are truly no boundaries placed on our educational mission and impact. Our institution is not fixed in time and place, but increasingly transcends generations and locations. Expansion to Western NC will give even more students the opportunity to discover their interests and talents, to prepare to lead, serve, and tackle the challenges faced by our state, our nation, and our world.

More students, faculty, staff, and friends will experience the transformative effect of NCSSM and will in turn, as you do every day, share their unique gifts with our school, this state, and beyond.\n\n\n \n\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nTodd\n\n\n \n\n\nTodd Roberts, Ed.D.\n\n\nChancellor","_author":{"_id":"4016419787839704","type":"person","groupIds":["831287658225102007"],"firstName":"Todd","lastName":"Roberts","title":"Todd Roberts","email":"roberts@ncssm.edu","phone":"919-416-2700","departmentIds":["221423314561606179","725376149204881873"],"jobTitle":"Chancellor","startDate":"August 2010","slug":"todd-roberts","residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"limit":1,"aspectRatio":[1,1],"itemType":{"widget":true,"label":"Image(s)","icon":"icon-image","css":"slideshow"},"widget":true,"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w359781923711071933","ids":["196692033561044377"],"extras":{"196692033561044377":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":10,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"196692033561044377","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-11-17T15:56:32.593Z","name":"robert-todd563","title":"roberts todd","extension":"jpg","md5":"fca581b66f2d7f4bccb53b88dd6ef61c","width":172,"height":228,"searchText":"robert todd563 roberts todd none todd roberts none jpg images jpeg lisa watts","portrait":true,"ownerId":"26034325849012107","crops":[{"top":"28","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"},{"top":"10","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"},{"top":"13","left":"0","width":"172","height":"201"}],"description":"","credit":"","tags":["todd roberts"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":10,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"todd-roberts:thumbnail"},"body":"I am a native of Durham (born in Watts Hospital, actually!) and I began my education career as a Durham Public Schools teacher and principal.

North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM) announced today a $5 million gift from &lt;a href=\"https://www.carolinashealthcareblueridge.org/\"&gt;Carolinas HealthCare System Blue Ridge&lt;/a&gt; at the groundbreaking ceremony for the school’s new campus in Morganton. The gift conveys naming rights for a state-of-the-art comprehensive student wellness and activities center at NCSSM-Morganton. This is the largest gift in the 40-year history of NCSSM, an internationally recognized leader in high school STEM education and a member of the 17-campus &lt;a href=\"https://www.northcarolina.edu/\"&gt;University of North Carolina System&lt;/a&gt;. CHS Blue Ridge, a community healthcare system with hospitals in Morganton and Valdese, has been serving families in the community for nearly 113 years and sees this gift as a way to support the future prosperity and well-being of the region.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The new school represents a significant investment in our community,” said Kathy C. Bailey, President and CEO of CHS Blue Ridge. “We feel the school will bring new families and jobs to the area which will enhance the quality of life for those in our community including our own employees.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The board felt very strongly about this donation and we worked hard to make it happen,” said Mike Bridges, Chairman of the CHS Blue Ridge Board of Directors. “We are committed to improving health, of course, and economics plays a large part of that. We want to make this a successful venture for Burke County.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM Chancellor Todd Roberts was honored to accept the gift on behalf of NCSSM-Morganton on Friday. “We are extremely grateful to CHS Blue Ridge for its investment in our new campus and steadfast commitment to the Unifour region,” Roberts said. “This extraordinary gift represents the largest private donation in our school’s history and will help bring the NCSSM experience to hundreds more students each year.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top instructors and mentors in science, technology, engineering, and math. Recognizing the contributions NCSSM has made in its four decades of educating business leaders, entrepreneurs, and even an astronaut, stakeholders from across the state see NCSSM-Morganton as a catalyst for economic development. The school is forging innovative partnerships in the western part of the state that are helping to develop the campus and curriculum through monetary donations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“With the advent of NCSSM-Morganton, our university system reaches into new territory by adding a campus in the Unifour region,” said Dr. Bill Roper, Interim President of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.northcarolina.edu/\"&gt;University of North Carolina System&lt;/a&gt;. “NCSSM is known nationally and internationally as a world-class teaching institution and this new campus will further our mission to bring transformative results for our entire state and its citizens — empowering students, spurring innovation, and enriching the surrounding communities.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;CHS Blue Ridge’s $5 million gift represents a significant step toward the $10 million goal to support construction of the new Morganton campus. The gift also puts the total raised for the new campus at more than $7 million since 2018. The groundbreaking ceremony for NCSSM-Morganton provided the perfect backdrop against which to celebrate this leadership gift among the many others that have made a major impact on the fundraising goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Since day one, NCSSM-Morganton has benefited from an incredibly passionate cross-section of champions and investors who span all sectors and represent local, state, and national connections,” said Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning. “Today’s groundbreaking ceremony illustrated this support as more than 500 partners and friends braved the heat to celebrate and commemorate the start of construction for the campus that will open in fall 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM offers an innovative and immersive growth experience for North Carolina’s brightest minds. The new campus will provide living and learning space for 300 academically-talented students from across North Carolina and increase distance education and summer learning opportunities for many more, extending NCSSM’s world-renowned academic programs beyond its original home in Durham. NCSSM is the only high school among the 17 campuses of the UNC System and will be the first program of its kind anywhere with two physical locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the capital campaign, visit &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus\"&gt;ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;###&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\n**&lt;a href=\"https://photos.app.goo.gl/z6ntRByJTUdwnbNF7\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Images will be available in this folder&lt;/a&gt; following the groundbreaking event.**&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mo9jj0Mx4d1VoxpZmopsEOFi4evE3KnO/view?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Access the groundbreaking event program here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About NCSSM:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/\"&gt;The North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; is a world-class public high school with statewide reach offering students the skills and knowledge to design their own future.

It will strengthen the network for WPCC by providing increased opportunities for those pursuing a post secondary education and participating in workforce development programs, empowering rural North Carolinians with in-demand skills for regional industry.  \n\n\n \n\n\nThe proposal was supported by community partners including Burke County, Burke County Chamber of Commerce, Burke Development Inc., Western Piedmont Community College, and the City of Morganton as well as the statewide organizations of MCNC and the NC Rural Center.\n\n\n ","_author":{"_id":"77486040830680451","type":"person","createdAt":"2018-08-08T18:14:23.218Z","login":true,"directory":true,"published":true,"firstName":"Margo","lastName":"Metzger","title":"Margo Metzger &#39;97","email":"margo.metzger@ncssm.edu","phone":"","departmentIds":["336715775307835564"],"undefined":{"336715775307835564":{}},"jobTitle":"Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate","startDate":"August 7, 2018","tags":[],"residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w435444738112984037","ids":["487767666233863984"],"extras":{"487767666233863984":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"487767666233863984","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2018-08-14T19:59:21.703Z","name":"margo-metzger","title":"Margo Metzger","extension":"jpg","md5":"4c01b5f2c094c086f0720035231221c7","width":1024,"height":1536,"searchText":"margo metzger margo metzger none ncssm morganton none jpg images jpeg will mack 03","portrait":true,"ownerId":"412642278318013293","crops":[{"top":"256","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"},{"top":"4","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"}],"description":"","credit":"","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"margo-metzger:thumbnail"},"body":"Margo Knight Metzger &#39;97 is the Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate for the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and works on the Morganton Campus project.

The grant will convey naming rights to be determined at the school’s new campus that will open in Morganton in 2021. BWF is the largest single contributor in the history of NCSSM with a cumulative total of nearly $3.2 million. This latest grant will help foster a cutting edge learning experience for students, as the school drives continuous educational innovation with a data-science influenced program that includes applied learning experiences with regional institutions and industries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“This partnership with BWF brings together two respected institutions focused on research, mentorship, and real world learning for aspiring young North Carolinians,“ said NCSSM Chancellor Todd Roberts. “This grant will extend the curriculum in ways that foster development of  future STEM leaders in North Carolina.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BWF’s mission is to advance the biomedical sciences by supporting research and other scientific and educational activities. In addition to providing support for early career scientists to become independent investigators and enhancing underfunded fields in biomedical science, BWF is a major contributor to the advancement of STEM education in North Carolina. Its mission aligns with NCSSM, as the new campus will feature a curriculum centered around data science designed to equip the next generation of problem solvers in medicine, technology, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe the best method for engaging students in science is to allow students to immerse themselves in the scientific process and let them do what comes naturally — ask questions,” said Dr. John Burris, President of BWF. “NCSSM-Morganton will give more North Carolina students the chance to participate in hands-on, cutting-edge experiments in partnership with local industries, better preparing them for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM is a bastion of innovation offering the promise of an immersive growth experience for North Carolina’s brightest minds. Construction on the residential high school in Morganton begins June 21 and will be completed in time for the 2021-2022 school year. The new campus will provide learning and living space for 300 academically-talented students from across North Carolina, extending its world-renowned academic programs beyond its original home in Durham.

Leviton, an engineering giant with an innovative range of products for electrical, lighting and network solutions, has operated in the region for more than 50 years, and they see this gift as a way to support NCSSM’s mission of growing future leaders and problem solvers in their industry and state. NCSSM’s expansion to Morganton is creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals to partner with the institution to enable the innovative programming and infrastructure that is a hallmark of the NCSSM experience.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leviton’s $250,000 gift to name a state-of-the-art engineering lab is the latest donation made during this fundraising period for the new NCSSM-Morganton campus, slated to open in 2021. NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top instructors and mentors in STEM fields with an added focus on data science. Recognizing the contributions NCSSM has made in its four decades of educating business leaders, entrepreneurs, &lt;a href=\"https://www.northcarolina.edu/node/3945\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;and even astronauts&lt;/a&gt;, stakeholders from across the state see NCSSM-Morganton as a catalyst for economic development in the western part of the state and are helping to develop the campus and curriculum through monetary donations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“For over 50 years, Leviton has been proud to be a part of Morganton and Burke County and has been dedicated to supporting the advancement of this community and Western North Carolina,” said Glenn Privette, Director of Human Resources for Leviton. Tim Lockard, Senior Director of Operations added, “It is exciting to see and to be a part of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics’ historic expansion to a new campus in our region. This school is vital to the development and future of our educational system and youth.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning, was honored to accept the check on behalf of NCSSM-Morganton on Monday, and he is excited to see fundraising gaining momentum as the campus development continues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We are incredibly grateful to Leviton for their investment in our new campus and their ongoing commitment to the Unifour region,” Baxter said. “This generous gift represents the largest private donation received to date for NCSSM-Morganton and speaks to the value that Leviton assigns to the mission and impact of our institution.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM announced a &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/donate/ncssm-morganton-capital-projects\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Barn Raising Campaign&lt;/a&gt; for the Morganton campus in fall 2018 with a goal of raising $3 million in private donations from regional stakeholders to support the construction of its new campus. To date, the NCSSM Foundation has recorded more than 100 gifts that total more than $500,000 in support of NCSSM’s emerging campus in Morganton. Inaugural members of the NCSSM-Morganton donor recognition society will be celebrated during a special, invitation-only event connected to the campus groundbreaking on the evening of June 21.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the Barn Raising Campaign, visit &lt;a

the company’s $250,000 donation to create the Leviton Engineering Lab at the school’s new campus in Morganton. Leviton, an engineering giant with an innovative range of products for electrical, lighting and network solutions, has operated in the region for more than 50 years, and they see this gift as a way to support NCSSM’s mission of growing future leaders and problem solvers in their industry and state. NCSSM’s expansion to Morganton is creating new opportunities for businesses and individuals to partner with the institution to enable the innovative programming and infrastructure that is a hallmark of the NCSSM experience.\n\n\n \n\n\nLeviton’s $250,000 gift to name a state-of-the-art engineering lab is the latest donation made during this fundraising period for the new NCSSM-Morganton campus, slated to open in 2021. NCSSM-Morganton promises academically-talented students from anywhere in North Carolina the opportunity to study advanced classes with top instructors and mentors in STEM fields with an added focus on data science. Recognizing the contributions NCSSM has made in its four decades of educating business leaders, entrepreneurs, and even astronauts, stakeholders from across the state see NCSSM-Morganton as a catalyst for economic development in the western part of the state and are helping to develop the campus and curriculum through monetary donations.\n\n\n“For over 50 years, Leviton has been proud to be a part of Morganton and Burke County and has been dedicated to supporting the advancement of this community and Western North Carolina,” said Glenn Privette, Director of Human Resources for Leviton. Tim Lockard, Senior Director of Operations added, “It is exciting to see and to be a part of the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics’ historic expansion to a new campus in our region. This school is vital to the development and future of our educational system and youth.”\n\n\nKevin Baxter, Director of Western Campus Planning, was honored to accept the check on behalf of NCSSM-Morganton on Monday, and he is excited to see fundraising gaining momentum as the campus development continues.\n\n\n“We are incredibly grateful to Leviton for their investment in our new campus and their ongoing commitment to the Unifour region,” Baxter said. “This generous gift represents the largest private donation received to date for NCSSM-Morganton and speaks to the value that Leviton assigns to the mission and impact of our institution.”\n\n\nNCSSM announced a Barn Raising Campaign for the Morganton campus in fall 2018 with a goal of raising $3 million in private donations from regional stakeholders to support the construction of its new campus. To date, the NCSSM Foundation has recorded more than 100 gifts that total more than $500,000 in support of NCSSM’s emerging campus in Morganton. Inaugural members of the NCSSM-Morganton donor recognition society will be celebrated during a special, invitation-only event connected to the campus groundbreaking on the evening of June 21.  \n\n\nFor more information about the development of NCSSM-Morganton, including information about the Barn Raising Campaign, visit ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus.\n","_author":{"_id":"77486040830680451","type":"person","createdAt":"2018-08-08T18:14:23.218Z","login":true,"directory":true,"published":true,"firstName":"Margo","lastName":"Metzger","title":"Margo Metzger &#39;97","email":"margo.metzger@ncssm.edu","phone":"","departmentIds":["336715775307835564"],"undefined":{"336715775307835564":{}},"jobTitle":"Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate","startDate":"August 7, 2018","tags":[],"residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w435444738112984037","ids":["487767666233863984"],"extras":{"487767666233863984":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"487767666233863984","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2018-08-14T19:59:21.703Z","name":"margo-metzger","title":"Margo Metzger","extension":"jpg","md5":"4c01b5f2c094c086f0720035231221c7","width":1024,"height":1536,"searchText":"margo metzger margo metzger none ncssm morganton none jpg images jpeg will mack 03","portrait":true,"ownerId":"412642278318013293","crops":[{"top":"256","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"},{"top":"4","left":"0","width":"1024","height":"1024"}],"description":"","credit":"","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":4,"left":0,"width":1024,"height":1024}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"margo-metzger:thumbnail"},"body":"Margo Knight Metzger &#39;97 is the Strategic Communications &amp; Initiatives Associate for the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics and works on the Morganton Campus project.

Kevin Baxter, director of western campus planning for North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, announced the formation of two new steering teams that will focus on external engagement and campus operations Morganton. In both cases, the teams comprise diverse people representing the institution, the UNC System, K-12 and higher education, business and industry, and governments throughout western North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oahTpXSN-v4CDHqDRv9LI9DuR2-RKtarE6BKYeLYl0Q/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;External Engagement Steering Team&lt;/a&gt; will advise and inform NCSSM-Morganton planning through the development of strategic initiatives aimed at building a robust and inclusive community of champions and benefactors. This work will particularly address the need for an additional $20 million to support the construction of the campus to meet the vision laid out in the &lt;a href=\"https://www.ncssm.edu/morgantoncampus/site-location\"&gt;master plan&lt;/a&gt;. NCSSM is committed to raising $5 million in private support while advocating for $15 million in state appropriations for the capital construction needs of the new campus, scheduled to open in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robin Nicholson, government and community relations district manager for Duke Energy, is one of 15 members named to the external engagement steering team. “Education, and especially STEM education, of our future leaders is a process we must begin now,” she says. “Expanding NCSSM to Burke County is a significant step for education, the economy, our citizens of North Carolina, and the overall health of this area. Duke Energy is honored to be a strong participant in the planning and development of this expansion and looks forward to working with all students and leadership of this campus.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uq12XPF4TNmEZDIF0WMXJD1hWJiFZkefTXrgTaDvFvs/edit?usp=sharing\"&gt;Campus Operations Steering Team&lt;/a&gt; will engage an equally important focus, advising and informing NCSSM-Morganton planning on schematic design, physical infrastructure, business processes, innovative partnerships throughout the region and state, and the connections of the new campus within the broader institution.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Campus Operations Steering Team comprises 16 leaders from across the region and the institution. David Bennett, chief operating officer at EJ Victor and cofounder of Fonta Flora Brewery in Morganton, is one of those who answered the call to serve: “As a native of Morganton, I am honored and humbled to be part of a project that has the potential to shape our region for years to come.

Kevin Baxter, director of western campus planning for North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, announced the formation of two new steering teams that will focus on external engagement and campus operations Morganton. In both cases, the teams comprise diverse people representing the institution, the UNC System, K-12 and higher education, business and industry, and governments throughout western North Carolina.\n\n\nThe External Engagement Steering Team will advise and inform NCSSM-Morganton planning through the development of strategic initiatives aimed at building a robust and inclusive community of champions and benefactors. This work will particularly address the need for an additional $20 million to support the construction of the campus to meet the vision laid out in the master plan. NCSSM is committed to raising $5 million in private support while advocating for $15 million in state appropriations for the capital construction needs of the new campus, scheduled to open in 2021.\n\n\nRobin Nicholson, government and community relations district manager for Duke Energy, is one of 15 members named to the external engagement steering team. “Education, and especially STEM education, of our future leaders is a process we must begin now,” she says. “Expanding NCSSM to Burke County is a significant step for education, the economy, our citizens of North Carolina, and the overall health of this area. Duke Energy is honored to be a strong participant in the planning and development of this expansion and looks forward to working with all students and leadership of this campus.”\n\n\nThe Campus Operations Steering Team will engage an equally important focus, advising and informing NCSSM-Morganton planning on schematic design, physical infrastructure, business processes, innovative partnerships throughout the region and state, and the connections of the new campus within the broader institution.\n\n\nThe Campus Operations Steering Team comprises 16 leaders from across the region and the institution. David Bennett, chief operating officer at EJ Victor and cofounder of Fonta Flora Brewery in Morganton, is one of those who answered the call to serve: “As a native of Morganton, I am honored and humbled to be part of a project that has the potential to shape our region for years to come. Having the western campus of NCSSM located in Morganton is a generational event, and how the campus is woven into the existing fabric of our community will be extremely important in providing educational and enrichment opportunities for its students.”\n\n\nNCSSM is excited to engage these partners as phase two of planning is initiated. While the work of these two steering teams has begun, the institution envisions the rollout of three additional teams this summer, provided operational support is approved by the General Assembly. “We are indebted to so many who have invested their time and talent in the NCSSM-Morganton planning process,” said Todd Roberts, NCSSM’s chancellor. “This next phase of activity will be especially important in identifying critically needed funding for the project while also designing an innovative and efficient infrastructure to manage our new campus.”  \n\n\nThis next planning period will seek to capitalize on the positive outcomes and framework of the project’s initial phase, according to Baxter. “As you may recall, our core planning team worked alongside administrators, architects, and consultants to wrap up our advance planning phase for the project last fall. We are now prepared to operationalize much of this work as we construct the eighteenth campus of the UNC System, the first such campus commissioned to deliver a comprehensive, modern approach toward STEM education in western North Carolina.”","_category":{"_id":"684891561223034135","type":"category","createdAt":"2015-10-07T17:52:05.012Z","title":"On Campus","published":true,"categoryType":"news","slug":"on-campus","sortTitle":"on campus","publishedAt":"2015-10-07T17:52:05.013Z","highSearchText":"on campus undefined on campus on campus news","highSearchWords":["on","campus","undefined","news"],"lowSearchText":"on campus undefined on campus on campus news","searchSummary":""},"_author":{"_id":"733511375983589659","type":"person","createdAt":"2016-12-08T00:02:36.124Z","login":true,"directory":true,"published":true,"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Baxter","title":"Kevin Baxter","email":"kevin.baxter@ncssm.edu","phone":"828-448-3540","departmentIds":["336715775307835564"],"undefined":{"336715775307835564":{}},"jobTitle":"Director of Western Campus Planning and Project Management","startDate":"January 9, 2017","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"residency":"","gradYear":"","location":"","occupation":"","thumbnail":{"items":[{"limit":1,"aspectRatio":[1,1],"itemType":{"widget":true,"label":"Image(s)","icon":"icon-image","css":"slideshow"},"widget":true,"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w881044940201260871","ids":["912487148664267013"],"extras":{"912487148664267013":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"912487148664267013","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2019-10-01T20:41:28.229Z","name":"kevin-baxter","title":"Kevin Baxter","extension":"jpg","md5":"e534eedc4550dc9223923f328b7753fd","width":644,"height":644,"searchText":"kevin baxter kevin baxter none ncssm morganton none jpg images jpeg will mack 03","portrait":true,"ownerId":"412642278318013293","description":"","credit":"","tags":["ncssm-morganton"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]}],"type":"area","slug":"kevin-baxter:thumbnail"},"body":"Kevin Baxter is the Director of Western Campus Planning for the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics.

\nFlexible ways to reach advanced students \nFlexible ways to reach your advanced students\n\n\n\n\nUsing our interactive video conferencing studios and our expertise in STEM education for talented students, we help public schools offer courses in hard-to-staff subject areas. It&#39;s a low- to no-cost way to support your STEM goals and offer advanced coursework to smaller groups of students.\n\n\nAffiliate partnerships\n\n\nIn our affiliate partnerships, we provide interactive video conferencing enrichment sessions to a district’s students and/or district-specific teacher professional development sessions. Students and teachers from Greene County Schools, for example, regularly attend events and workshops such as our Ethics and Leadership Conference at NCSSM’s Durham campus. Greene County teachers also make use of videos and other digital assets and interactive video conference offerings to enrich their current class materials.\n\n\nCooperative partnerships\n\n\nThrough cooperative partnerships, we provide courses for credit to students through interactive video conferencing. The Mt. Airy City Schools superintendent and high school staff, for example, turned one classroom into two video conferencing sites equipped with basic, low-cost equipment, and staffed by a facilitator who can support and supervise students in both rooms. The changes allowed a small high school — within a city school system, and with just a handful of students needing more challenging work — to add nine advanced courses to its catalogue.\n\n\nEngaged partnerships\n\n\nOur most sustained, committed partnerships involve working with a school district on providing programming for students — jointly creating curriculum for a STEM-focused school or jointly seeking grant opportunities to expand educational opportunities. Burke County Public Schools have created a concentrated hub for high school and community college STEM offerings. Together, we have worked to garner grant funding for the school district to supplement NCSSM’s free offerings with paid programs, including a number of advanced classes. As part of this engaged partnership, Burke County teachers commit to offering feedback on the course materials over time.\n \nNCSSM provides interactive video conference courses to schools across North Carolina, a flexible and cost-effective solution for offering advanced STEM courses. ","blockGroups":{"main":{"blocks":[{"type":"rightColumn","id":"228729065227124521"}]},"main_228729065227124521_col1":{"blocks":[{"type":"box","id":"156363151447101102"}]},"main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main":{"blocks":[{"type":"oneColumn","id":"577345811982603857"},{"type":"twoColumn","id":"782356279288708642"}]}},"main_306323492258499741_banner":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_306323492258499741_banner","items":[{"image":{"items":[{"position":"middle","size":"full","type":"slideshow","id":"w427881471536630797","ids":["10013641981083927"],"extras":{"10013641981083927":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"10013641981083927","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-10-23T16:59:05.450Z","name":"enrichments1","title":"enrichments1","extension":"jpg","md5":"372692dc6e2a29a3847ab8153add0d63","width":2592,"height":1936,"searchText":"enrichments1 enrichments1 none stem enrichments nc public schools none jpg images jpeg lisa watts","landscape":true,"ownerId":"26034325849012107","description":"","credit":"","tags":["stem enrichments","nc public schools"],"private":false,"crops":[{"top":"128","left":"20","width":"2572","height":"1353"}],"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]}],"type":"area","slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_306323492258499741_banner.items.0.image"},"color":"navy","header":"Boosting the bandwidth \nof North Carolina&#39;s\npublic schools","buttonText":"","linkType":"internal","pageId":null,"link":null,"type":"banner"}],"type":"area"},"rightColumn":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:rightColumn","items":[{"header":"NC Public Schools","pageId":"656346013569461500","type":"sectionContents"},{"stat":"Ready to partner?","body":"Email partnership@ncssm.edu","caption":"","color":"purple","linkType":"external","pageId":null,"link":"mailto:partnership@ncssm.edu","type":"facts"},{"widget":true,"editView":"1","type":"people","id":"w79678575592491457","limitByTag":1,"limit":5,"by":"id","tags":[],"ids":["857591570159856830"],"_snippets":[{"_id":"857591570159856830","type":"person","groupIds":["831287658225102007","842481420321129398","23684999650108280","907495999926272819"],"firstName":"Melissa","lastName":"Thibault","title":"Melissa Thibault","email":"thibault@ncssm.edu","phone":"919-416-2877","departmentIds":["56576487717205951"],"jobTitle":"Vice Chancellor for Distance Education and Extended Programs","building":"ETC","office":"","slug":"melissa-thibault","featuredImage":{"items":[],"type":"area","slug":"melissa-thibault:featuredImage"},"thumbnail":{"items":[{"limit":1,"aspectRatio":[1,1],"itemType":{"widget":true,"label":"Image(s)","icon":"icon-image","css":"slideshow"},"widget":true,"type":"slideshow","ids":["60038974564404989"],"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"extras":{"60038974564404989":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":2,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}},"position":"middle","size":"full","id":"w514059786593576562","_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"60038974564404989","length":13630,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-11-12T15:28:49.684Z","name":"thibault-melissa660","title":"thibault melissa660","extension":"jpg","md5":"cd80044ff49f23f65c209a7950f93a6c","width":172,"height":228,"searchText":"thibault melissa660 thibault melissa660 none none jpg images jpeg none","portrait":true,"ownerId":"anon-undefined","crops":[{"top":"2","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"},{"top":"28","left":"0","width":"172","height":"172"}],"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false,"crop":{"top":2,"left":0,"width":172,"height":172}}]}],"type":"area","slug":"melissa-thibault:thumbnail"},"body":"Melissa Rihm Thibault leads the school in online learning, delivery of instruction using interactive video conferencing, teacher professional development, and student enrichment programs, including the statewide Summer Ventures in Math and Science pre-college research experience program.

His students work in small groups, their desks turned to face each other. In a moment they will begin a timed measurement of temperature, then use exponential functions to create a mathematical model for the data collected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wickham is an 18-year classroom veteran, the last five at VCHS. The previous 13 years he taught at some of the top high schools in his native Jamaica.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Durham, a 40-minute drive down I-85, veteran North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics teacher Maria Hernandez observes Wickham’s classroom via interactive videoconference in the school’s distance learning studios. On one monitor is a wide view of Wickham’s class. Another, which replicates what Wickham’s class sees, displays Hernandez’s teaching materials. Other monitors contain additional views and teaching resources. Studio lights illuminate her against a green screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez describes herself as “a guest” in Wickham’s class, invited several times each week into his and other precalculus classrooms across the state as a teaching partner in an effort to lay the groundwork for a new approach to teacher leadership in hard-to-staff schools and subjects. This pilot was initiated by Public Impact, a Chapel Hill-based research and consulting firm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public Impact created Opportunity Culture, an initiative to restructure pre-K–12 schools to extend the reach of excellent teachers, principals, and their teams to more students, for more pay, within recurring school budgets. The foundation of Opportunity Culture is the multi-classroom leader, or MCL, an excellent teacher who leads a small teaching team while continuing to teach. The MCL provides guidance and frequent on-the-job coaching, co-planning, co-teaching, and modeling of instruction. In 2018–19 alone, Opportunity Culture reached more than 55,000 students in 300 schools over nine states, and more than 1,800 teachers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public Impact had developed the idea of “Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership” -- an MCL leading a team of teachers located elsewhere -- as a way to provide teacher-leaders for hard-to-staff schools and subjects. But the mechanics of the idea needed testing before being fully prototyped within Opportunity Culture. With funding from the College Board, Public Impact partnered with NCSSM to do just that. How could a remotely located MCL connect successfully with teachers and students? How would the technology work? How could an MCL and teachers in several schools schedule the time needed to plan, collaborate and teach together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result was the creation of Hernandez’s role. So far, it’s going great -- so NCSSM and Public Impact are now exploring how to offer remotely located multi-classroom leaders to other school districts throughout the state using Opportunity Culture’s full design. The financially efficient approach seems hard to beat, expanding access while losing none of its academic zip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez addresses Wickham’s class as though she were in the room. “I’d like you to make a conjecture,” she says, “about what the temperature will be over the course of this time frame.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“When we are through collecting the data,” Wickham adds in Henderson, “we will compare it to what you thought it would be, and we will see if you were right or wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez turns to her own instrumentation where she is running the same experiment. “This is cool,” she says to the students at Vance High.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Here we go,” Wickham says and begins the project timer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Math is a passion for Wickham. At Vance County High School, he teaches, or has taught, Math 1, Math 3, Advanced Functions and Modeling, and AP Calculus AB, as well as precal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“My brain is always working where math is concerned,” Wickham says. “It just has me engaged. That’s why I love it so much. And I want my students to see that it’s not just random numbers that we put in a calculator and get an answer. I just want them to make sense of it on a daily basis and see that it’s applicable in real-life situations.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though experienced at well-respected schools back home, Wickham’s curiosity about the education systems in more developed countries led him to the United States through an international teacher program.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same sense of curiosity sparked his interest in working with a remotely located MCL, which he learned about through Vance County’s curriculum specialist. Many schools in Vance are already using full Multi-Classroom Leadership with in-person MCLs. But teachers in advanced high school classes often do not have enough peers to form a team within a school, much less to have a team leader. NCSSM’s role in the partnership was especially intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the credentials of the pilot’s partners, Wickham approached it with a wait-and-see attitude. His uncertainty evaporated upon meeting the “well-learned” team members. His greatest enthusiasm is reserved for Hernandez.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve learned so much,” he says, “especially from Maria, in terms of questioning techniques, giving students time to collaborate, [and] the feedback she has given. I’m implementing all of that feedback into the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wickham isn’t the only one gaining new skills. He points to increases in his students’ confidence with the subject matter. “I have seen where quite a number of them really have grown in that they are more expressive,” he says. “They will take time to discuss the problems with their fellow classmates, and they are willing to share their thoughts and ideas about how they arrived at a certain solution. That’s a very good thing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The timed portion of the experiment complete, Hernandez asks the students to consider their original guess. “How does the data you collected compare with your conjecture? Take a minute to talk to your neighbor about this.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wickham discovers that one of the students, Hunter, accurately predicted what the final results would be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez is enthused. “As mathematicians,” she says to the class, “people often want you to make predictions. If you can become skilled at that, just like we’ve done here today, then you can become very valuable and sought after.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The data leads to an exponential function. With a stylus and her laptop, Hernandez leads students into an equation, then turns it over to the students to complete. Wickham dives in, moving through his class to lend guidance where needed. A student named Maya hesitantly approaches the camera to work directly with Hernandez. Sharing their work with each other, they together solve the equation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez congratulates her. “You did such great work!” she says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maya smiles, her head dipping slightly with shy pride. “Thank you,” she says, and drifts back to her seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At 10:40 Wickham wraps up his class. Students gather their books, slide back from their desks. “You did a fine job today,” Hernandez tells them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Says Wickham, “They did very well on this, I agree.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The monitors in Durham go dark, and Hernandez slides back from her own desk. “I really see a lot of similarities between these students in Mr. Wickham’s class and the students we have here from counties like Vance,” Hernandez says. “These equations are not easy. They’re doing some really powerful math. I can show you video of this class from the beginning of this semester to now, and the growth is just incredible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And Mr. Wickham,” she adds, smiling, “he’s really incredible, too.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fortunate connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NCSSM owes its role in the test of Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership to Grayson Cooper, a 2008 graduate of NCSSM and senior consultant with Public Impact. He is also the co-founder of ENC STEM, a non-profit focused on providing disadvantaged high school students in eastern North Carolina with “high quality STEM learning opportunities and leadership training.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cooper’s knowledge of the challenges facing rural students and teachers is personal; he grew up in a small, rural community tucked just inside the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. After graduating from college, he taught math for three years through Teach For America in northeastern North Carolina, a region dotted with tiny schools and school districts critically short of resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges faced by such districts, they’re filled with talent, just like their better-resourced brethren. When a district doesn’t have an appropriate person to lead as an MCL in a specialized subject, teachers still have the same potential -- they just need a supportive team leader. “Opportunity Culture is really about trusting great teachers and trusting their judgement to know what works best for their students,” Cooper says of the program. “It’s about having them take on roles where they have the autonomy, the authority, and the resources to be able to implement the change that they see is needed within their schools. I really wish that I had had that sort of support when I started teaching.” Public Impact has heard in many interviews of Opportunity Culture educators how even veteran teachers appreciate that support and collaboration as they focus on being lifelong learners themselves,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Public Impact had been considering the possibility of adding remotely located MCLs to the mix since Opportunity Culture’s inception in 2009, well before Cooper joined the organization. The idea of partnering with NCCSM to make it happen gained traction once Cooper came onboard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It was a situation of ‘College Board is interested in this, we’re (Public Impact) interested in this, who can we get to partner?’” Cooper says. “That’s where my status as an NCSSM alum and working really closely with the school for a number of years worked out really well.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took two years to align all the moving parts, but the effort paid off. “Being able to hit the ground running with Science and Math, which has such good relationships and infrastructure across the state, was really crucial to this project being a success,” Cooper says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math is math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ashley Knox, a fourth-year math teacher at New Bern High School, also joined the pilot as a team teacher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Raised and educated in eastern North Carolina, Knox is at home among her students. Her love of numbers led to a master’s in math from East Carolina University, and then to New Bern High, where she teaches Math II (honors), Math III and precalculus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez is again in the classroom, the 140 miles between New Bern and Durham erased by the real-time connection between NCSSM and Knox’s Wednesday morning precal class. The same precalculus principles that applied on Monday morning at Vance County High also apply this morning in Knox’s classroom. Math is math, no matter where you are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Graphing sine and cosine is the day’s challenge. Hernandez pulls up a video of a young girl on a park swing. It’s her daughter, Olivia. She swings back and forth, hair in her face one moment, flowing behind her the next. Two orange traffic cones mark a spot in front of and behind her. The laughter of children off-camera rises and falls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I want you to think about her horizontal and vertical position,” Hernandez says. “What do you notice? What do you wonder? Think about this like mathematicians. Turn to your neighbor and talk with them about what it might have to do with trigonometric functions.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The class hums with multiple conversations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knox winds through the room, looking for signs of creative, mathematical thought. Satisfied with her students’ progress, Knox says, “I think they’re ready now, Mrs. H.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What did you notice?” Hernandez asks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Hunter, you and Cole had a good conversation going,” Knox says. “Tell us what you noticed.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Each time she goes back and forth is one cycle,” Hunter says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hernandez graphs the student input. A few minutes later she runs an animation showing Olivia’s motion as data points. She ties it all back into sine and cosine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay, now I want you guys to find a model for the horizontal and vertical position of the swinger,” she says. “Think about trigonometric functions and transformation functions.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knox takes over, leading her kids through their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A student approaches the camera and shows Maria her work. She’s found a truly unique way to solve a problem. “That’s great!” Hernandez says. “I’ve been teaching a hundred years and that’s the first time I’ve seen that. That’s great!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like Wickham, Knox was drawn to joining Hernandez’s team due to NCSSM’s involvement. “I‘ve always been very curious about that school and how students learn there,” Knox says, “so I thought of this more as a partnership where they can see what it’s like with everyday students ... and we can continue to challenge our honors students into becoming ready for AP Calculus, or even beyond. It’s been a great experience involving more of the modeling instead of what I normally do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The collaborative spirit among the team teachers has been incredible, Knox points out. In addition to using materials shared with participants by NCSSM, the teachers themselves have worked together to build resources.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“A lot of the time teachers don’t have resources available to them through their school,” Knox says, “so I think it’s nice that we have this cohort of teachers helping each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much to gain from collaboration. The students gain as well as the teachers gain. Education is a constant change, and so teaching has to be a constant change, too.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“She’s kind of a mover and a shaker,” Hernandez says of Knox. “She’s been really good about trying to grow as a teacher [and] she really likes to learn.”&lt;/p&gt;"},{"widget":true,"editView":"1","type":"slideshow","id":"w56899370471497974","ids":["287472149577740791"],"extras":{"287472149577740791":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":17,"_items":[{"_id":"287472149577740791","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2019-05-24T13:07:51.771Z","name":"img-3762-donaldson-wickham","title":"Sarah Donaldson and Stanford Wickham participate in remotely located MCL program","extension":"jpg","md5":"de9314f700cb35193429f718207cd384","width":5184,"height":3456,"searchText":"img 3762 donaldson wickham sarah donaldson and stanford wickham participate in remotely located mcl program none public impact opportunity culture math deep none jpg images jpeg beatrice moss","landscape":true,"ownerId":"572443527334305089","description":"","credit":"","tags":["public impact","opportunity culture","math","deep"],"private":false,"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]},{"type":"richText","content":"&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustaining and growing Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For this semester, NCSSM used temporary grant funds to cover pilot expenses, including the remotely located MCL’s salary. But one of the five Opportunity Culture Principles is that MCL roles -- including extra pay -- are funded through reallocations of regular school budgets so they can be sustained over time without grants. Public Impact’s routine work with Opportunity Culture schools includes working with teams of teachers and administrators to make budget reallocation decisions that fit each school.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Melissa Thibault, NCSSM’s Vice Chancellor for Distance Education and Extended Programs, is eager to continue the school’s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We want to keep doing it, we have the will to do it, and we have identified some areas where we can continue to build capacity within some of the schools that we are working with,” Thibault says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’d love to continue working with Public Impact on this,” she says. “There’s a lot of mission alignment between their organization and ours. We have here the teaching expertise and the IVC infrastructure to connect with partner schools, but Public Impact is the organization with the relationships and the management capacity and the product.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thibault believes so strongly in the program that she and her colleagues at NCSSM are eager to collaborate with Public Impact on a design for future scale and sustainability. “This is one way that we can retain talent and magnify the impact of great teachers,” she says. “That, to me, is at the heart of why this is an important program.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give and receive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the remainder of the semester, Hernandez will have the good fortune to continue working alongside Knox, Wickham, and the other teachers on the team -- Corrette Miller at Lexington Senior High School in Lexington, Sarah Donaldson at North Pitt High School in Bethel, and Jocelyn Thammavong, a teammate of Ashley Knox’s at New Bern High. In every instance, the project stands as an incredible example of how public and private partners can leverage their strengths to extend to students statewide the knowledge and skills they need to live their best lives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We have a great group of teachers who signed up to do this because they wanted to grow as professionals,” Hernandez says.“I learn so much from them, too. The opportunity both to work with the students and work with the teachers is really valuable. It’s really something that, I think, is a rare occasion for us.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To learn more about NCSSM’s work with the Opportunity Culture initiative, check out &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a

course of this time frame when we are through collecting the data wickham adds in henderson we will compare it to what you thought it would be and we will see if you were right or wrong hernandez turns to her own instrumentation where she is running the same experiment this is cool she says to the students at vance high here we go wickham says and begins the project timer math is a passion for wickham at vance county high school he teaches or has taught math 1 math 3 advanced functions and modeling and ap calculus ab as well as precal my brain is always working where math is concerned wickham says it just has me engaged that s why i love it so much and i want my students to see that it s not just random numbers that we put in a calculator and get an answer i just want them to make sense of it on a daily basis and see that it s applicable in real life situations though experienced at well respected schools back home wickham s curiosity about the education systems in more developed countries led him to the united states through an international teacher program that same sense of curiosity sparked his interest in working with a remotely located mcl which he learned about through vance county s curriculum specialist many schools in vance are already using full multi classroom leadership with in person mcls but teachers in advanced high school classes often do not have enough peers to form a team within a school much less to have a team leader ncssm s role in the partnership was especially intriguing despite the credentials of the pilot s partners wickham approached it with a wait and see attitude his uncertainty evaporated upon meeting the well learned team members his greatest enthusiasm is reserved for hernandez i ve learned so much he says especially from maria in terms of questioning techniques giving students time to collaborate and the feedback she has given i m implementing all of that feedback into the classroom wickham isn t the only one gaining new skills he points to increases in his students confidence with the subject matter i have seen where quite a number of them really have grown in that they are more expressive he says they will take time to discuss the problems with their fellow classmates and they are willing to share their thoughts and ideas about how they arrived at a certain solution that s a very good thing the timed portion of the experiment complete hernandez asks the students to consider their original guess how does the data you collected compare with your conjecture take a minute to talk to your neighbor about this wickham discovers that one of the students hunter accurately predicted what the final results would be hernandez is enthused as mathematicians she says to the class people often want you to make predictions if you can become skilled at that just like we ve done here today then you can become very valuable and sought after the data leads to an exponential function with a stylus and her laptop hernandez leads students into an equation then turns it over to the students to complete wickham dives in moving through his class to lend guidance where needed a student named maya hesitantly approaches the camera to work directly with hernandez sharing their work with each other they together solve the equation hernandez congratulates her you did such great work she says maya smiles her head dipping slightly with shy pride thank you she says and drifts back to her seat at 10 40 wickham wraps up his class students gather their books slide back from their desks you did a fine job today hernandez tells them says wickham they did very well on this i agree the monitors in durham go dark and hernandez slides back from her own desk i really see a lot of similarities between these students in mr wickham s class and the students we have here from counties like vance hernandez says these equations are not easy they re doing some really powerful math i can show you video of this class from the beginning of this semester to now and the growth is just incredible and mr wickham she adds smiling he s really incredible too a fortunate connection ncssm owes its role in the test of remotely located multi classroom leadership to grayson cooper a 2008 graduate of ncssm and senior consultant with public impact he is also the co founder of enc stem a non profit focused on providing disadvantaged high school students in eastern north carolina with high quality stem learning opportunities and leadership training cooper s knowledge of the challenges facing rural students and teachers is personal he grew up in a small rural community tucked just inside the nantahala national forest in western north carolina after graduating from college he taught math for three years through teach for america in northeastern north carolina a region dotted with tiny schools and school districts critically short of resources despite the challenges faced by such districts they re filled with talent just like their better resourced brethren when a district doesn t have an appropriate person to lead as an mcl in a specialized subject teachers still have the same potential they just need a supportive team leader opportunity culture is really about trusting great teachers and trusting their judgement to know what works best for their students cooper says of the program it s about having them take on roles where they have the autonomy the authority and the resources to be able to implement the change that they see is needed within their schools i really wish that i had had that sort of support when i started teaching public impact has heard in many interviews of opportunity culture educators how even veteran teachers appreciate that support and collaboration as they focus on being lifelong learners themselves public impact had been considering the possibility of adding remotely located mcls to the mix since opportunity culture s inception in 2009 well before cooper joined the organization the idea of partnering with nccsm to make it happen gained traction once cooper came onboard it was a situation of college board is interested in this we re public impact interested in this who can we get to partner cooper says that s where my status as an ncssm alum and working really closely with the school for a number of years worked out really well it took two years to align all the moving parts but the effort paid off being able to hit the ground running with science and math which has such good relationships and infrastructure across the state was really crucial to this project being a success cooper says math is math ashley knox a fourth year math teacher at new bern high school also joined the pilot as a team teacher raised and educated in eastern north carolina knox is at home among her students her love of numbers led to a master s in math from east carolina university and then to new bern high where she teaches math ii honors math iii and precalculus hernandez is again in the classroom the 140 miles between new bern and durham erased by the real time connection between ncssm and knox s wednesday morning precal class the same precalculus principles that applied on monday morning at vance county high also apply this morning in knox s classroom math is math no matter where you are graphing sine and cosine is the day s challenge hernandez pulls up a video of a young girl on a park swing it s her daughter olivia she swings back and forth hair in her face one moment flowing behind her the next two orange traffic cones mark a spot in front of and behind her the laughter of children off camera rises and falls i want you to think about her horizontal and vertical position hernandez says what do you notice what do you wonder think about this like mathematicians turn to your neighbor and talk with them about what it might have to do with trigonometric functions the class hums with multiple conversations knox winds through the room looking for signs of creative mathematical thought satisfied with her students progress knox says i think they re ready now mrs h what did you notice hernandez asks hunter you and cole had a good conversation going knox says tell us what you noticed each time she goes back and forth is one cycle hunter says hernandez graphs the student input a few minutes later she runs an animation showing olivia s motion as data points she ties it all back into sine and cosine okay now i want you guys to find a model for the horizontal and vertical position of the swinger she says think about trigonometric functions and transformation functions knox takes over leading her kids through their calculations a student approaches the camera and shows maria her work she s found a truly unique way to solve a problem that s great hernandez says i ve been teaching a hundred years and that s the first time i ve seen that that s great like wickham knox was drawn to joining hernandez s team due to ncssm s involvement i ve always been very curious about that school and how students learn there knox says so i thought of this more as a partnership where they can see what it s like with everyday students and we can continue to challenge our honors students into becoming ready for ap calculus or even beyond it s been a great experience involving more of the modeling instead of what i normally do the collaborative spirit among the team teachers has been incredible knox points out in addition to using materials shared with participants by ncssm the teachers themselves have worked together to build resources a lot of the time teachers don t have resources available to them through their school knox says so i think it s nice that we have this cohort of teachers helping each other there s so much to gain from collaboration the students gain as well as the teachers gain education is a constant change and so teaching has to be a constant change too she s kind of a mover and a shaker hernandez says of knox she s been really good about trying to grow as a teacher and she really likes to learn sustaining and growing remotely located multi classroom leadership for this semester ncssm used temporary grant funds to cover pilot expenses including the remotely located mcl s salary but one of the five opportunity culture principles is that mcl roles including extra pay are funded through reallocations of regular school budgets so they can be sustained over time without grants public impact s routine work with opportunity culture schools includes working with teams of teachers and administrators to make budget reallocation decisions that fit each school melissa thibault ncssm s vice chancellor for distance education and extended programs is eager to continue the school s work we want to keep doing it we have the will to do it and we have identified some areas where we can continue to build capacity within some of the schools that we are working with thibault says we d love to continue working with public impact on this she says there s a lot of mission alignment between their organization and ours we have here the teaching expertise and the ivc infrastructure to connect with partner schools but public impact is the organization with the relationships and the management capacity and the product thibault believes so strongly in the program that she and her colleagues at ncssm are eager to collaborate with public impact on a design for future scale and sustainability this is one way that we can retain talent and magnify the impact of great teachers she says that to me is at the heart of why this is an important program give and receive for the remainder of the semester hernandez will have the good fortune to continue working alongside knox wickham and the other teachers on the team corrette miller at lexington senior high school in lexington sarah donaldson at north pitt high school in bethel and jocelyn thammavong a teammate of ashley knox s at new bern high in every instance the project stands as an incredible example of how public and private partners can leverage their strengths to extend to students statewide the knowledge and skills they need to live their best lives we have a great group of teachers who signed up to do this because they wanted to grow as professionals hernandez says i learn so much from them too the opportunity both to work with the students and work with the teachers is really valuable it s really something that i think is a rare occasion for us to learn more about ncssm s work with the opportunity culture initiative check out this video written by brian faircloth with contributions from public impact staff","searchSummary":"\nTeacher Stanford Wickham is busy with his Monday morning precalculus class of 14 students at Vance County High School, a few miles southeast of downtown Henderson. His students work in small groups, their desks turned to face each other. In a moment they will begin a timed measurement of temperature, then use exponential functions to create a mathematical model for the data collected.\n\n\nWickham is an 18-year classroom veteran, the last five at VCHS. The previous 13 years he taught at some of the top high schools in his native Jamaica.\n\n\nIn Durham, a 40-minute drive down I-85, veteran North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics teacher Maria Hernandez observes Wickham’s classroom via interactive videoconference in the school’s distance learning studios. On one monitor is a wide view of Wickham’s class. Another, which replicates what Wickham’s class sees, displays Hernandez’s teaching materials. Other monitors contain additional views and teaching resources. Studio lights illuminate her against a green screen.\n\n\nHernandez describes herself as “a guest” in Wickham’s class, invited several times each week into his and other precalculus classrooms across the state as a teaching partner in an effort to lay the groundwork for a new approach to teacher leadership in hard-to-staff schools and subjects. This pilot was initiated by Public Impact, a Chapel Hill-based research and consulting firm.\n\n\nPublic Impact created Opportunity Culture, an initiative to restructure pre-K–12 schools to extend the reach of excellent teachers, principals, and their teams to more students, for more pay, within recurring school budgets. The foundation of Opportunity Culture is the multi-classroom leader, or MCL, an excellent teacher who leads a small teaching team while continuing to teach. The MCL provides guidance and frequent on-the-job coaching, co-planning, co-teaching, and modeling of instruction. In 2018–19 alone, Opportunity Culture reached more than 55,000 students in 300 schools over nine states, and more than 1,800 teachers.\n\n\nPublic Impact had developed the idea of “Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership” -- an MCL leading a team of teachers located elsewhere -- as a way to provide teacher-leaders for hard-to-staff schools and subjects. But the mechanics of the idea needed testing before being fully prototyped within Opportunity Culture. With funding from the College Board, Public Impact partnered with NCSSM to do just that. How could a remotely located MCL connect successfully with teachers and students? How would the technology work? How could an MCL and teachers in several schools schedule the time needed to plan, collaborate and teach together?\n\n\nThe result was the creation of Hernandez’s role. So far, it’s going great -- so NCSSM and Public Impact are now exploring how to offer remotely located multi-classroom leaders to other school districts throughout the state using Opportunity Culture’s full design. The financially efficient approach seems hard to beat, expanding access while losing none of its academic zip.\n\n\nHernandez addresses Wickham’s class as though she were in the room. “I’d like you to make a conjecture,” she says, “about what the temperature will be over the course of this time frame.”\n\n\n“When we are through collecting the data,” Wickham adds in Henderson, “we will compare it to what you thought it would be, and we will see if you were right or wrong.”\n\n\nHernandez turns to her own instrumentation where she is running the same experiment. “This is cool,” she says to the students at Vance High.\n\n\n“Here we go,” Wickham says and begins the project timer.\n\n\nMath is a passion for Wickham. At Vance County High School, he teaches, or has taught, Math 1, Math 3, Advanced Functions and Modeling, and AP Calculus AB, as well as precal.\n\n\n“My brain is always working where math is concerned,” Wickham says. “It just has me engaged. That’s why I love it so much. And I want my students to see that it’s not just random numbers that we put in a calculator and get an answer. I just want them to make sense of it on a daily basis and see that it’s applicable in real-life situations.”\n\n\nThough experienced at well-respected schools back home, Wickham’s curiosity about the education systems in more developed countries led him to the United States through an international teacher program.\n\n\nThat same sense of curiosity sparked his interest in working with a remotely located MCL, which he learned about through Vance County’s curriculum specialist. Many schools in Vance are already using full Multi-Classroom Leadership with in-person MCLs. But teachers in advanced high school classes often do not have enough peers to form a team within a school, much less to have a team leader. NCSSM’s role in the partnership was especially intriguing.\n\n\nDespite the credentials of the pilot’s partners, Wickham approached it with a wait-and-see attitude. His uncertainty evaporated upon meeting the “well-learned” team members. His greatest enthusiasm is reserved for Hernandez.\n\n\n“I’ve learned so much,” he says, “especially from Maria, in terms of questioning techniques, giving students time to collaborate, [and] the feedback she has given. I’m implementing all of that feedback into the classroom.”\n\n\nWickham isn’t the only one gaining new skills. He points to increases in his students’ confidence with the subject matter. “I have seen where quite a number of them really have grown in that they are more expressive,” he says. “They will take time to discuss the problems with their fellow classmates, and they are willing to share their thoughts and ideas about how they arrived at a certain solution. That’s a very good thing.”\n\n\nThe timed portion of the experiment complete, Hernandez asks the students to consider their original guess. “How does the data you collected compare with your conjecture? Take a minute to talk to your neighbor about this.”\n\n\nWickham discovers that one of the students, Hunter, accurately predicted what the final results would be.\n\n\nHernandez is enthused. “As mathematicians,” she says to the class, “people often want you to make predictions. If you can become skilled at that, just like we’ve done here today, then you can become very valuable and sought after.”\n\n\nThe data leads to an exponential function. With a stylus and her laptop, Hernandez leads students into an equation, then turns it over to the students to complete. Wickham dives in, moving through his class to lend guidance where needed. A student named Maya hesitantly approaches the camera to work directly with Hernandez. Sharing their work with each other, they together solve the equation.\n\n\nHernandez congratulates her. “You did such great work!” she says.\n\n\nMaya smiles, her head dipping slightly with shy pride. “Thank you,” she says, and drifts back to her seat.\n\n\nAt 10:40 Wickham wraps up his class. Students gather their books, slide back from their desks. “You did a fine job today,” Hernandez tells them.\n\n\nSays Wickham, “They did very well on this, I agree.”\n\n\nThe monitors in Durham go dark, and Hernandez slides back from her own desk. “I really see a lot of similarities between these students in Mr. Wickham’s class and the students we have here from counties like Vance,” Hernandez says. “These equations are not easy. They’re doing some really powerful math. I can show you video of this class from the beginning of this semester to now, and the growth is just incredible.\n\n\n“And Mr. Wickham,” she adds, smiling, “he’s really incredible, too.”\n\n\n \n\n\nA fortunate connection\n\n\nNCSSM owes its role in the test of Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership to Grayson Cooper, a 2008 graduate of NCSSM and senior consultant with Public Impact. He is also the co-founder of ENC STEM, a non-profit focused on providing disadvantaged high school students in eastern North Carolina with “high quality STEM learning opportunities and leadership training.”\n\n\nCooper’s knowledge of the challenges facing rural students and teachers is personal; he grew up in a small, rural community tucked just inside the Nantahala National Forest in western North Carolina. After graduating from college, he taught math for three years through Teach For America in northeastern North Carolina, a region dotted with tiny schools and school districts critically short of resources.\n\n\nDespite the challenges faced by such districts, they’re filled with talent, just like their better-resourced brethren. When a district doesn’t have an appropriate person to lead as an MCL in a specialized subject, teachers still have the same potential -- they just need a supportive team leader. “Opportunity Culture is really about trusting great teachers and trusting their judgement to know what works best for their students,” Cooper says of the program. “It’s about having them take on roles where they have the autonomy, the authority, and the resources to be able to implement the change that they see is needed within their schools. I really wish that I had had that sort of support when I started teaching.” Public Impact has heard in many interviews of Opportunity Culture educators how even veteran teachers appreciate that support and collaboration as they focus on being lifelong learners themselves,\n\n\nPublic Impact had been considering the possibility of adding remotely located MCLs to the mix since Opportunity Culture’s inception in 2009, well before Cooper joined the organization. The idea of partnering with NCCSM to make it happen gained traction once Cooper came onboard.\n\n\n“It was a situation of ‘College Board is interested in this, we’re (Public Impact) interested in this, who can we get to partner?’” Cooper says. “That’s where my status as an NCSSM alum and working really closely with the school for a number of years worked out really well.”\n\n\nIt took two years to align all the moving parts, but the effort paid off. “Being able to hit the ground running with Science and Math, which has such good relationships and infrastructure across the state, was really crucial to this project being a success,” Cooper says.\n\n\n \n\n\nMath is math\n\n\nAshley Knox, a fourth-year math teacher at New Bern High School, also joined the pilot as a team teacher.\n\n\nRaised and educated in eastern North Carolina, Knox is at home among her students. Her love of numbers led to a master’s in math from East Carolina University, and then to New Bern High, where she teaches Math II (honors), Math III and precalculus.\n\n\nHernandez is again in the classroom, the 140 miles between New Bern and Durham erased by the real-time connection between NCSSM and Knox’s Wednesday morning precal class. The same precalculus principles that applied on Monday morning at Vance County High also apply this morning in Knox’s classroom. Math is math, no matter where you are.\n\n\nGraphing sine and cosine is the day’s challenge. Hernandez pulls up a video of a young girl on a park swing. It’s her daughter, Olivia. She swings back and forth, hair in her face one moment, flowing behind her the next. Two orange traffic cones mark a spot in front of and behind her. The laughter of children off-camera rises and falls.\n\n\n“I want you to think about her horizontal and vertical position,” Hernandez says. “What do you notice? What do you wonder? Think about this like mathematicians. Turn to your neighbor and talk with them about what it might have to do with trigonometric functions.”\n\n\nThe class hums with multiple conversations.\n\n\nKnox winds through the room, looking for signs of creative, mathematical thought. Satisfied with her students’ progress, Knox says, “I think they’re ready now, Mrs. H.”\n\n\n“What did you notice?” Hernandez asks.\n\n\n“Hunter, you and Cole had a good conversation going,” Knox says. “Tell us what you noticed.”\n\n\n“Each time she goes back and forth is one cycle,” Hunter says.\n\n\nHernandez graphs the student input. A few minutes later she runs an animation showing Olivia’s motion as data points. She ties it all back into sine and cosine.\n\n\n“Okay, now I want you guys to find a model for the horizontal and vertical position of the swinger,” she says. “Think about trigonometric functions and transformation functions.”\n\n\nKnox takes over, leading her kids through their calculations.\n\n\nA student approaches the camera and shows Maria her work. She’s found a truly unique way to solve a problem. “That’s great!” Hernandez says. “I’ve been teaching a hundred years and that’s the first time I’ve seen that. That’s great!”\n\n\nLike Wickham, Knox was drawn to joining Hernandez’s team due to NCSSM’s involvement. “I‘ve always been very curious about that school and how students learn there,” Knox says, “so I thought of this more as a partnership where they can see what it’s like with everyday students ... and we can continue to challenge our honors students into becoming ready for AP Calculus, or even beyond. It’s been a great experience involving more of the modeling instead of what I normally do.”\n\n\nThe collaborative spirit among the team teachers has been incredible, Knox points out. In addition to using materials shared with participants by NCSSM, the teachers themselves have worked together to build resources.\n\n\n“A lot of the time teachers don’t have resources available to them through their school,” Knox says, “so I think it’s nice that we have this cohort of teachers helping each other.\n\n\n“There’s so much to gain from collaboration. The students gain as well as the teachers gain. Education is a constant change, and so teaching has to be a constant change, too.”\n\n\n“She’s kind of a mover and a shaker,” Hernandez says of Knox. “She’s been really good about trying to grow as a teacher [and] she really likes to learn.” \nSustaining and growing Remotely Located Multi-Classroom Leadership\n\n\nFor this semester, NCSSM used temporary grant funds to cover pilot expenses, including the remotely located MCL’s salary. But one of the five Opportunity Culture Principles is that MCL roles -- including extra pay -- are funded through reallocations of regular school budgets so they can be sustained over time without grants. Public Impact’s routine work with Opportunity Culture schools includes working with teams of teachers and administrators to make budget reallocation decisions that fit each school.\n\n\nMelissa Thibault, NCSSM’s Vice Chancellor for Distance Education and Extended Programs, is eager to continue the school’s work.\n\n\n“We want to keep doing it, we have the will to do it, and we have identified some areas where we can continue to build capacity within some of the schools that we are working with,” Thibault says.\n\n\n“We’d love to continue working with Public Impact on this,” she says. “There’s a lot of mission alignment between their organization and ours. We have here the teaching expertise and the IVC infrastructure to connect with partner schools, but Public Impact is the organization with the relationships and the management capacity and the product.”\n\n\nThibault believes so strongly in the program that she and her colleagues at NCSSM are eager to collaborate with Public Impact on a design for future scale and sustainability. “This is one way that we can retain talent and magnify the impact of great teachers,” she says. “That, to me, is at the heart of why this is an important program.”\n\n\n \n\n\nGive and receive\n\n\nFor the remainder of the semester, Hernandez will have the good fortune to continue working alongside Knox, Wickham, and the other teachers on the team -- Corrette Miller at Lexington Senior High School in Lexington, Sarah Donaldson at North Pitt High School in Bethel, and Jocelyn Thammavong, a teammate of Ashley Knox’s at New Bern High. In every instance, the project stands as an incredible example of how public and private partners can leverage their strengths to extend to students statewide the knowledge and skills they need to live their best lives.\n\n\n“We have a great group of teachers who signed up to do this because they wanted to grow as professionals,” Hernandez says.“I learn so much from them, too.

subject areas. It&#39;s a low- to no-cost way to support your STEM goals and offer advanced coursework to smaller groups of students.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Affiliate partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In our affiliate partnerships, we provide interactive video conferencing enrichment sessions to a district’s students and/or district-specific teacher professional development sessions. Students and teachers from &lt;strong&gt;Greene County Schools&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, regularly attend events and workshops such as our Ethics and Leadership Conference at NCSSM’s Durham campus. Greene County teachers also make use of videos and other digital assets and interactive video conference offerings to enrich their current class materials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Cooperative partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through cooperative partnerships, we provide courses for credit to students through interactive video conferencing. The &lt;strong&gt;Mt. Airy City Schools&lt;/strong&gt; superintendent and high school staff, for example, turned one classroom into two video conferencing sites equipped with basic, low-cost equipment, and staffed by a facilitator who can support and supervise students in both rooms. The changes allowed a small high school — within a city school system, and with just a handful of students needing more challenging work — to add nine advanced courses to its catalogue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Engaged partnerships&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our most sustained, committed partnerships involve working with a school district on providing programming for students — jointly creating curriculum for a STEM-focused school or jointly seeking grant opportunities to expand educational opportunities. &lt;strong&gt;Burke County Public Schools&lt;/strong&gt; have created a concentrated hub for high school and community college STEM offerings. Together, we have worked to garner grant funding for the school district to supplement NCSSM’s free offerings with paid programs, including a number of advanced classes. As part of this engaged partnership, Burke County teachers commit to offering feedback on the course materials over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;"}],"type":"area"},"main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col2":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col2","items":[{"type":"richText","content":"&lt;p&gt;NCSSM provides interactive video conference courses to schools across North Carolina, a flexible and cost-effective solution for offering advanced STEM courses. &lt;/p&gt;"},{"text":"9th-12th grade courses","linkType":"external","pageId":"818690342908236260","link":"http://uniapp.ncssm.edu/registrar/catalog/ivc_courses.php","color":"btn-info","size":"btn-lg","width":"btn-fit","type":"button"}],"type":"area"},"main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col1":{"slug":"/for-nc-schools/nc-public-schools:main_228729065227124521_col1_156363151447101102_main_782356279288708642_col1","items":[{"editView":"1","widget":true,"type":"slideshow","id":"w895289603486725374","ids":["369315775243836253"],"extras":{"369315775243836253":{"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}},"showTitles":false,"showDescriptions":false,"showCredits":false,"_id":1,"_items":[{"_id":"369315775243836253","length":null,"group":"images","createdAt":"2015-10-29T19:44:23.191Z","name":"img-3671-x2","title":"Garrett Love teaching IVC class","extension":"jpg","md5":"0b67896d022f5efc501de828430da36c","width":1280,"height":854,"searchText":"img 3671 x2 garrett love teaching ivc class none garrett love teaching instructors ivc distance education none jpg images jpeg sophie williams","landscape":true,"ownerId":"471213998808079838","description":"","credit":"","tags":["garrett love","teaching","instructors","ivc","distance education"],"private":false,"crops":[{"top":"3","left":"58","width":"1104","height":"844"},{"top":"13","left":"206","width":"914","height":"841"},{"top":"17","left":"249","width":"924","height":"821"},{"top":"10","left":"564","width":"716","height":"844"},{"top":"12","left":"12","width":"1220","height":"706"},{"top":"0","left":"422","width":"858","height":"790"}],"hyperlink":null,"hyperlinkTitle":"","hyperlinkTarget":false}]}],"type":"area"}}},{"id":"866518575441696049","sectionTitle":"Support NCSSM","pageId":"801194674202421804","description":"Make a gift to the NCSSM Foundation, or get involved.
