Since that time, six Xavier history majors have completed internships at Amistad and, without exception, they have said their internship was among their most rewarding experiences as a Xavier student. Our first intern in 2009, Chianta Dorsey, was assigned to a manuscript processing project in which included the arrangement, preservation and description of the papers of Homer McEwen who was a minister in the United Church of Christ, member of the Board of Trustees of Dillard University, and played an active role in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during the Civil Rights Movement.\u0026nbsp;Chianta\u0027s\u0026nbsp;internship experience led her to pursue a career as an archivist. Today she holds a dual master\u0027s in History and Library Information Science from Simmons College in Boston, MA and is Reference Archivist at the Amistad Research Center.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor more information, please contact Sr. Barbara Hughes at\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022mailto:bhughes@xula.edu\u0022\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebhughes@xula.edu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;or see the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022http://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/\u0022\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmistad Research Center\u0027s Website\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003eWe also support internships at the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\u0022https://noma.org/learn/students/internships\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Orleans Museum of Art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\u0022http://www.nationalww2museum.org/employment/internship-apply.html\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorld War II Museum\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, among others!

Since that time, six Xavier history majors have completed internships at Amistad and, without exception, they have said their internship was among their most rewarding experiences as a Xavier student. Our first intern in 2009, Chianta Dorsey, was assigned to a manuscript processing project in which included the arrangement, preservation and description of the papers of Homer McEwen who was a minister in the United Church of Christ, member of the Board of Trustees of Dillard University, and played an active role in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during the Civil Rights Movement.\u0026nbsp;Chianta\u0027s\u0026nbsp;internship experience led her to pursue a career as an archivist. Today she holds a dual master\u0027s in History and Library Information Science from Simmons College in Boston, MA and is Reference Archivist at the Amistad Research Center.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor more information, please contact Sr. Barbara Hughes at\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022mailto:bhughes@xula.edu\u0022\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebhughes@xula.edu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;or see the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022http://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/\u0022\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmistad Research Center\u0027s Website\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003eWe also support internships at the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\u0022https://noma.org/learn/students/internships\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Orleans Museum of Art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\u0022http://www.nationalww2museum.org/employment/internship-apply.html\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorld War II Museum\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, among others!

The study of philosophy includes training in logic and the techniques of evaluating varying points of view, and training in ethics regarding conceptions of the good life and the importance of achieving justice in society. It also includes consideration of the ideas of the true, the good, and the beautiful as keys to self-knowledge and the concern for others. Instruction in these areas of thought aims at making connections with the other fields of knowledge and the education of the whole person. It is concerned to supply students with the means to confront the issues of today and to provide a basis for an active, reflective life that will aid them in assuming leadership roles in their chosen careers.\u003c/p\u003e"}],"addressSnippetCity":"","addressSnippetState":[],"contactSnippetPhoneNumber":"504-520-5406","contactSnippetLinkedIn":"","contactSnippetInstagram":"","system":{"id":"237ee63a-5404-4d71-91e7-6c4d67044933","name":"Philosophy","codename":"philosophy_237ee63","type":"department","sitemap_locations":[],"last_modified":"2019-07-01T17:08:30.0152861Z","language":"default"},"type":[{"name":"Academic","codename":"academic"}],"programsBackground":[],"staffBackground":[],"redirectTo":[]},{"addressSnippetMap":"","resources":[{"html":"\u003ch2\u003eResources\u003c/h2\u003e"},{"html":"\u003ch3\u003eSisters of the Blessed Sacrament\u003c/h3\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022http://www.katharinedrexel.org\u0022\u003ewww.katharinedrexel.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"}],"opportunities":[{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"}],"organizations":[{"html":"\u003ch3\u003eFor more information about the Department of Theology,\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\u0022http://www2.xula.edu/theology/index.html\u0022 data-new-window=\u0022true\u0022 target=\u0022_blank\u0022 rel=\u0022noopener noreferrer\u0022\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/h3\u003e"}],"programs":[],"contactSnippetTwitter":"","contactSnippetWebAddress":"","addressSnippetZip":"","addressSnippetAddress":"","staff":[],"banner":[{"name":"Theology.jpg","description":null,"type":"image/jpeg","size":454819,"url":"https://preview-assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/fe4e660e-85ed-0023-f96f-6d77d24a5fdb/48d79e1c-f770-4525-b855-113df5abcd2d/Theology.jpg"}],"building":"","contactSnippetYoutube":"","contactSnippetFacebook":"","contactSnippetEMailAddress":"","name":"Theology","summary":"","overview":[{"html":"\u003cp\u003eThe Theology Program promotes a more just and humane society within the context of faith and theological reflection.

In the Spring of 2009 the History Department saw the fulfillment of a long deferred dream of an agreement with the Amistad Research Center for an internship program for Xavier Students. Since that time, six Xavier history majors have completed internships at Amistad and, without exception, they have said their internship was among their most rewarding experiences as a Xavier student. Our first intern in 2009, Chianta Dorsey, was assigned to a manuscript processing project in which included the arrangement, preservation and description of the papers of Homer McEwen who was a minister in the United Church of Christ, member of the Board of Trustees of Dillard University, and played an active role in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during the Civil Rights Movement.\u0026nbsp;Chianta\u0027s\u0026nbsp;internship experience led her to pursue a career as an archivist. Today she holds a dual master\u0027s in History and Library Information Science from Simmons College in Boston, MA and is Reference Archivist at the Amistad Research Center.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor more information, please contact Sr. Barbara Hughes at\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022mailto:bhughes@xula.edu\u0022\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebhughes@xula.edu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026nbsp;or see the\u0026nbsp;\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\u0022http://www.amistadresearchcenter.org/\u0022\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmistad Research Center\u0027s Website\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"},{"html":"\u003cp\u003eWe also support internships at the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\u0022https://noma.org/learn/students/internships\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Orleans Museum of Art\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;and the\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\u0022http://www.nationalww2museum.org/employment/internship-apply.html\u0022\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorld War II Museum\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, among others!
